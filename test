__label__Positive	QUICK RESPONSE GOOD PRODUCT
__label__Positive	I love all the options that Amazon provides for sending gift cards by email The card selection is broad and diverse I cannot imagine anyone not finding what they are looking for It can often be sterile and boring to get a gift card via email not that the gift is not appreciated though and receiving one with a greeting that is funny sweet clever  just the right touch  certainly makes the gift feel well really like a gift Great idea I appreciate that Amazon does not charge for the greeting too
__label__Positive	Worked so easy
__label__Negative	My friend never received her gift card Im very disappointed and Ive found no way of resolving this problem online Help would be appreciated
__label__Positive	I was looking for a gift for my secret sister and wasnt quite sure what to buy One of her favorite things to do is to read so thats when I thought about an Amazon gift card  She loved it  This was a perfect gift
__label__Positive	Wonderful gift to give and receive Nothing like seeing the 0000s when you are buying frequently Admittedly it does encourage you to buy more
__label__Positive	We were invited to a wedding and didnt know what to get for the couple  We knew they love to play games so figured an Amazon gift card was a great way to give them the choice and also give them something they love
__label__Positive	It was very easy to find and to place my order  It was nice to get a 1000 gift certificate but it would have been nicer to be able to use it on any order and not just from Amazon
__label__Positive	Arrived within 24 hours The gift box was very nicethe gift recipient loved it Theres a little cutout on the bottom so it cant necessarily be reused for nongift card things but it will work quite nicely for future gift cards
__label__Positive	Speedy delivery and the product was of high quality Highly recommended for anyone as they are easy to seal with
__label__Positive	This gift card is very easy to use It was more convenient to use than the ebay gift card Thank you
__label__Positive	I find that giving an Amazon gift card is one of the best ways to be sure that a gift fits  It is certainly my very favorite gift to receive and I feel that everyone I give one to is equally pleased

__label__Positive	This is a great way to give gifts to friends who live overseas It allows them to make their own choice
__label__Positive	It was cute
__label__Negative	I bought three gift cards for my kids on March 18th19th and 20th but when they went to redeem one of them they were told that the card had expired in 2013  There is NO expiration date on the cardonly a code with the last 2 digits 13  According to the Gift Card Protection Law of 2013 gift cards MUST have clearly visible before purchase  Hopefully someone will contact me about this problem
__label__Positive	Gave this to my sister for Christmas she loved it
__label__Positive	I love being able to print my own gift cards  Its so much easier than making a trip to the store

__label__Positive	Easy gift easy to order and always appreciated
__label__Neutral	Sent this with a birthday message they did not get the birthday message so had to guess who sent it and called us to verify we sent it  what happened to the message I chose to go with it
__label__Positive	Bought as a gift for my sister
__label__Positive	With gift cards everyone is happy and gets to pick what they really want or add their own money to the gift  Yeah  Everyone wins
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are the perfect gift for anyone on your list It always fits its the right color  shipping is a dream  Two thumbs up
__label__Positive	When you cant decide on a gift for your husband you can never go wrong with his favorite thing
__label__Positive	Cute
__label__Positive	Love iTunes
__label__Positive	Giving my grandson a birthday present when he lives so far away was easy when I could give him a Fandango gift card that he could use to see the movies he wants to see
__label__Negative	I purchased this gift card for my niece  Amazon did give me a confirmation email and then an email stating it was undeliverable to the email address I provided  I double checked the email I had provided and it was the wrong one  I went to change the email address then it asks for you to verify the payment  I put in the payment information I used and it keeps giving me an error that its not matching  Amazon already charged my account 4000 for the gift card so why does it keep telling me the payment doesnt match  How do I get this resolved as there seems to be NO information on your website for this particular issue  At the very least nothing that has worked anyhow  I need resolution on this since my card was charged but my niece does not have her gift card  Very frustrated
__label__Positive	Gave them as a gift my friends loved them
__label__Positive	I love to give and receive Amazon kindle gift cards as it is so convenient and easy to use I can purchase all my books with a simple click and not worry about credit cards It is also a great gift to give to all book lovers
__label__Positive	Its a great idea for sending small gifts to friends
__label__Positive	Great gift idea for the book worm who loves her kindle  She loved it and was really excited to get home and buy books
__label__Positive	I used these as stocking stuffers during Christmas which my family loved They said they would use them to purchase their lunches
__label__Positive	I gave my granddaughter a Kindle last Christmas and she loves it so much  I thought that for her 4th birthday I would get her a gift card to use for new apps books games or whatever  She had a ball shopping on line with her Mom  Having her own money to spend is I think a very good experience
__label__Positive	This is one of our favorite restaurants Our gift card also came really fast
__label__Positive	Purchased a load of these for Christmas and every single one was sent on the scheduled date successfully Needless to say everyone loved their gift cards
__label__Positive	Love Amazon Giving gift cards is my way of sharing my great love and ease of online shopping
__label__Positive	Great idea for a gift  Amazon has everything
__label__Positive	More than pleased
__label__Positive	I mean how can you not like Texas Roadhouse It was great and it got there in time
__label__Positive	Person receiving gift was happy It fit her needs and expectations Would give her the same gift next Christmas day
__label__Neutral	You might have just said go buy it at Safeway or where ever  I printed it on photo paper so it would look nice but it was difficult to fold and looked pretty tacky by the time I succeeded in getting it into an envelope
__label__Positive	I dont understand all the bad reviews  Fandango is a site online where you buy tickets for movies at certain theaters  You cannot bring these to the theater to use tickets are bought online and can be picked up there  I thought most people understood that  I guess a lot of buyers are not familiar with Fandango  I got these as a lightening deal so it was cheaper so the fees do not concern me  It will be a gift for a college student and Im sure she will love them  Also sometimes look around for coupons to use on their site that helps some with the fees they charge
__label__Positive	As described and fast shipping
__label__Positive	As always the gift card was nice
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	worked out well good gift idea
__label__Positive	Its a gift card  it workednot sure how to rate this lol
__label__Positive	Different card image just the logo on all white card and all came preloaded with 10 I checked the balance of each card at Starbuckscom You will need to label the cards value yourself as it is not printed on there
__label__Positive	Very easy to send gift certificate
__label__Positive	Super cute way to gift a gift card to a graduate
__label__Positive	Another GREAT Christmas gift card
__label__Positive	Gift recipient loved this
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	Excellent gift
__label__Positive	Love that the gift card comes in different gift boxes and that it is free one day shipping Its the perfect gift that is available in different denominations Super easy to order being that its amazon now that I have discovered this I will go this route for gift giving versus the headache of shopping for something that the person will probably return or exchange anyways
__label__Positive	Very attractive
__label__Positive	Great idea The giftee loved it

__label__Positive	Perfect

__label__Positive	Gift card arrived fast
__label__Positive	So relieved to get a quick followup to gift card request  I had originally tired to get a gift card from Newegg and found they require lots of hurdles in order to request a gift card including needing to be at the home phone for a verification phone call AFTER payment had been made  I got a message from them that if no one was home for the phone call they would cancel the gift card  So needless to say I was thrilled when I saw the Amazon message that delivery would happen in 5 minutes  So much better than other places

__label__Positive	Its an IHOP gift card  Whats not to like  However if they are selling it for face value you could pick one up at the restaurant  The only reason to buy this from Amazon is convenience  However I got mine as a Lightning deal around Christmas time and saved 20 so if youre a real IHOP fan keep that in mind

__label__Positive	I love the fact that I can choose my own amount and can print a card to go with it Much fun
__label__Negative	What a scam

Amazon should have their own gift card mailing out center instead of using a third party for many reasons

1  it takes at least 7 days for delivery when it is only a gift card to be sent out

2  you can not include a happy birthday message in it or even say who it is from so nothing to slow down the sending of item

and not being able to personalize it screws it all up 

3  the sat I order the Starbucks card also order another item from amazon and it was received immediately on Monday

Amazon is too good of a company to put up with second rate suppliers     I hope

if not    at least be honest with your customers with a notice on their front page of what the deal really is    easier to buy card at Starbucks or wherever and send it than put up with this   
__label__Positive	Its a nice Birthday Gift
__label__Positive	EXCELENTE
__label__Positive	Was a fast gift I could send to a friend
__label__Positive	as what it says
__label__Positive	What can I say  Three 10 dinner cards for just about 30 You get what you pay for  Not a bad value but nothing too extraordinary either
__label__Positive	Nothing like an instant gift when you forget bosses day
__label__Positive	Product as expected Fast PRIME delivery
__label__Positive	Cute and easy to print and use
__label__Positive	Sent this to a granddaughter on her birthday The whole family loved it and watched it at least 5 times Made their dayand mine too
__label__Negative	Amazon is not honoring the gift card unless the recipient provides proof of purchase in the form of a receipt or other
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always a big hit for the recipients of Amazon Gift Cards  They love picking out their own gift  I have given many Amazon gift cards over the year
__label__Positive	Amazon gift card are always appreciated as gifts
__label__Positive	I love this bear and Amazon gift card combination I was planning to do some Christmas shopping on Amazon anyways and the bear was a nice bonus The bear is super cute dressed in Christmas clothing perfect for the holiday The bear is  great quality soft and fluffy The left feet has a Amazon logo Too bad I didnt get the bear from last years deal but Ill be on a lookout for this deal next year

__label__Positive	delivered as described
__label__Positive	My niece and nephew are getting to the age that Im just not sure what to get them  So I decided to let them pick their own stuff for each birthday and split one for Christmas  I chose the one that arrives as an email because it is so handy  You can pick one of Amazons designs upload your own photo or video and even suggest a gift on the card  You can have an item from the website put on the card as your suggestion  You can get one in a very nice card or gift box to ship overnight print it yourself to give or even post it on Facebook  You can pick the date for it to arrive as an email and you get charged a couple of days before its received  Ive sent several over time and will continue to do so  So far I have always picked an Amazon design picked the amount ordered in advance and all were received on time including Christmas day  Great convenient gift
__label__Positive	Works as expected
__label__Positive	Great buy
__label__Positive	Super cute
__label__Positive	Mom was really happy with the gift

__label__Positive	Every single  person I have purchased this gift card holder for has complimented how cute it was It is of great quality and looks just like an Amazon shipping box Completely adorable and unique
__label__Positive	I really enjoy purchasing these gift cards especially if they come in tins Theyre always a great gift if youre not sure what the person wants They can just decide themselves I also feel its better to get physical gift cards it really adds a personal touch to it but emailed gift cards are also good in a pinch
My friend was really glad to get this as a gift and the cupcake really sweetened the deal haha The tin is definitely reusable you can store other unused gift cards in it if you are so inclined

__label__Positive	My family and I love these gift cards We all shop at Amazon and the cards make gift giving easy for all ages
__label__Positive	I purchased a Gift Card on Amazon for my son so he can use it for his Kindle Fire I am very pleased I can do this as I was weary about putting my credit card on his account with the Kindle Fire and didnt want my son to abuse my credit card and go nuts buying anything and everything with it The alternative was the Amazon Gift Card This way when my son runs out of his gift of money he will have to wait to purchase until I purchase another Gift Card or he receives a card as a gift from a relative or friend  Very pleased with this option Thank you

Sadly my father passed away last year from cancer after battling it for 3 years so I will not be able to purchase this item again My father had a love for electronics so Amazon fit the bill a lot of the time and the plaid design I picked out represented his love of his Scottish background
Who knew a gift card would have so much behind it eh

__label__Negative	This company is one of the more ignorant ones I have ever had to deal with They take your credit card info and put you on autorenewal without you ever wanting that and then you have to send a mail by pigeons in order to cancel it You cant call email or just cancel online through their website Of course if the pigeon will get lost on its way they will claim it is not their problem and they will charge you So unless you own a highly trained pigeon dont bother getting this

__label__Positive	This Instantly printable amazoncom gift card was such a stress saver
We were attending a LARGE birthday party and not knowing what the birthday recipient would like or risk duplicating anyone elses gift this card was the perfect choice  Her words upon opening the envelope were What a perfect gift
Amazon has such a vast variety of products your gift recipient will enjoy picking out something wonderful
For those of you with teens and busy college aged kids THIS is the perfect gift for when theyve forgottenhad no time to buy a gift and are in a time crunch Most have a printer and a credit card so pass this on to them and dont be surprised if YOU get one of these yourself Lets face it most of our kids are nearly clueless as to what to get Mom and Dad or their grandparents but now the grandparents are downloading books to their tablets thanks to amazon gift cards

__label__Positive	Great gift card
__label__Positive	Of course this was lovedits Amazon

__label__Positive	My sisters love Starbucks worked out great
__label__Positive	So awesome to get a gift card inside a real tin  Definitely would do this anytime I need a gift card
__label__Positive	genial que se puedan adquirir estas tarjetas gift card son muy tiles y faciles de utilizar para una compra las recomiendo

__label__Positive	Amazon is tops  In service  professionalism  caring and selection   A great way to gift the recipient who lives across country or nearby
__label__Positive	Easy to buy  4 separate gifts for grandkids
__label__Negative	Did not work at the store Checked the website to look at the balance and it said invalid entry Customer service said that it was registering as having 50 on it but that the Whole Foods website was down and not reading it I purchased a physical gift card and the website was able to read that They sent me a replacement email gift card and that also did not work I requested a physical card or a full refund and have not heard back If you purchase this do NOT get the email option The physical gift cards seem to be fine but the email ones do not The personnel at the store said they have had several customers with the same problem
__label__Negative	I have had some serious issues with the card It was a gift and till this date no one has been able to fix the problem its angering dissapointing and the are unknowledgable about how to fix the issue I have lost 50 of my hard working money and a disapponted birthday person
__label__Negative	I received a gift card purchased on Amazon from airbnb When I went to redeem it it didnt work So I call the  on the back of the card that says Call for card and balance info and they said they cant help me unless it was purchased at airbnbcom They just said sorry cant help Eventually I got it to work by trying Safari as my browser not Chrome the horror and adding card info for purchasing Horrible experience with customer service but glad that eventually I got it to work
__label__Positive	I received two Amazon gift cards from friends who know of my Kindle addiction  Im no techie but entering and using them was so easy  Theyre a great gift
__label__Positive	item works well everything is as described
__label__Positive	This is great cause now I can get some snacks at the theatre while watching a movie
thanks
__label__Positive	My daughterinlaw enjoyed this gift card  She loves ordering from Amazon
__label__Neutral	This was sent to someone else not to me I assume its pretty good
__label__Positive	I was happy to have the gift card Whole foods still needs more variety however There are lots of organic foods that are just as good or better that they dont carry Hoping that now that Amazon owns them they might add some more variety to the market and strive to bring the prices down a bit
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards  the perfect solution for busy schedules or difficult giftees to shop for
We all have people in our lives for whom buying a gift presents a problem and this has now been resolved by the gift cards available everywhere  Amazons card is truly versatile since Amazon offers a huge variety of items to choose from Young people in particular love having this extra cash to buy their favorites online  I like the fact you can print up the gift card to include with your greeting card to the receiver
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	good

__label__Positive	Nice and easy nobrainer gift giving
__label__Positive	Excellent Loved Give these as gifts every Easter  
__label__Negative	Be careful buying this card  It is only good for the Microsoft store or the app store for phones or windows
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	Gave these to my children for Christmas and they were happy  What else is there
__label__Positive	Given how much I read on my Kindle an Amazon Gift Card is a perfect gift  In fact Ive gotten in the habit of giving them myself so the recipient can choose something they really want or need
__label__Positive	Its the perfect gift to give or receive Unlike a chain store Ive tried whose ecards take up to 2 days to send these gift cards process and send immediately Its a simple process of redeeming it and bam you are off shopping buying exactly what you want from Amazons vast selection
__label__Positive	Being a first time user of Amazon I was not familiar with the process I purchased a 5000 temporary visa card to pay for the gift card I did not realise that you could not pay like for like I had to purchase a 4900 gift card as it required 050 fee It took many attempts to work it out

Perhaps an idiots guide for first time users would be handy
__label__Positive	The gift card printed out on 8 12 x 11 and then folded into card size It printed nicely in color
__label__Positive	Easy gift option and was appreciated
__label__Positive	Wanted to give wedding gift to a friend and found this pretty good Most of the folks buy from amazon and the dress picture suits this gift
__label__Positive	Fun Spending my bonus gift card
__label__Positive	My Kids live in Europe mostly the postage for ChristmasBirthday gifts almost exceeds the value of the gift
The Amazon gift card allows me to spend that money on my kids instead of USPSFEDEXUPS etc
__label__Positive	Easy way to gift Adorable tin
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	thank you
__label__Positive	I can never go wrong ordering Regal Entertainment gift cards for my family in Florida who love to go to this movie theater
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always a huge hit because you can get anything you want Delivered on time and in good shape
__label__Positive	I check few others store and amazon was the essayist to understand and to but a gift card Love it faster and great presentation I wish they would have more options of desings for the cards
__label__Positive	Very cuteI am sure the giftreceiver loved it
__label__Positive	Great idea
__label__Positive	love the little box
__label__Neutral	Ok
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	The gift box was very nice  perfect for gift giving I didnt need any additional packaging
__label__Negative	I have no idea what this is or how to use it
__label__Positive	I gave this as a gift and the teenage recipient was thrilled with it
__label__Positive	Excelent
__label__Positive	The ease of loading this card that was given to me as a gift was outstanding  then it gave me the virtual on line tap to by books at my leisure Waiting for the specials to arrive and quickly being able to one click and it was there The ability to see your balance and transactions is just like running or using your own bank account really enjoyed recieving itusing it and recommend it to everyone who has a kindle Thanks Tash
__label__Positive	The gift box that is included with this at least the one I ordered was reeeally nice  Bow wasnt crushed either
Nicely done
__label__Positive	If there is no time for shopping ecard is the way to go Instead of driving around looking for a gift and greeting card ecard takes care of both at once  There is plenty of ecards to choose from for many occasions It did save my time
__label__Positive	As described Thank you
__label__Neutral	not the freashest but delivered at a good price
__label__Positive	Great gift for that Dad that has everything  He quickly loaded it to start making purchases for his Kindle Fire HD
__label__Positive	Awesome holiday cards
__label__Positive	It was very convenient
__label__Positive	Awesome stocking stuffer
__label__Positive	Went off without a hitch would definitely do again
__label__Positive	Actually sent this to my daughter over seas for Mothers Day I knew my little grand daughter would love coloring the picture for her Mommy and she did Great concept
__label__Positive	It was everything I expected it to be
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	always welcome and to get what is need later
__label__Positive	very convenient and nice looking
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card and this was such a cute design
__label__Positive	I dont like plastic gift cards I need to carry around or to places I dont shopdine at  If you want to give me a gift card just give me cash and let me do with it what I will unless of course its an Amazon gift card  Disney may be the happiest place on earth but Amazon is the happiest shopping location and this is perfect for those that cant just hand someone cash  Personally I dont really get gift card giving since Im going to know that you only got me a 3 or 5 gift card to a place where I need to spend 40 just to look at the merchandise  Just give me the cash instead or give me Amazon gift cards  As a guy I had butt pain from sitting on a wallet of plastic cards and paper receipts you cant read after putting them in your wallet any way  Dont drill baby drill to get more oil for more plastic gift cards print at home as its better for the planet
__label__Positive	Daughters always glad to get l00
__label__Positive	I gave this to my Nephew for Christmas What can I say what not to love about money
__label__Positive	This was exactly as pictured The packaging was clean and had no creases no one likes to give a gift that looks like it was manhandled and you know things arrive looking dusty but most importantly the gift recipient used it with no problems 
__label__Positive	all good

__label__Positive	Awesome way to give a gift
__label__Positive	A gift to my grandson
__label__Positive	On time  As it should be
__label__Positive	a lovely teddy bear and  free
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with Amazon gift cards  I give them as gifts inside of different holiday cards all year long
__label__Neutral	The card in the snowflake tin was very nice The tin just added to the gift
__label__Positive	I love it when i can get a discount on gift cards
__label__Negative	PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME WITH THIS I ordered 6 cards off of Amazon 4100 and 250 cards Three of the four 100 cards had the same card number  I also received 5 100 cards and only 1 50 card  When I tried to call and get things straightened out the first operator was really nice and realized that I had been sent 50 extra and annotated on my account that I was not to be billed for the extra 50  Upon looking at the cards after downloading them I noticed that three of the five 100 cards had the same card number applied to them  When I called Amazon back to inform them of this second error I was treated very rudely and was speaking to an operator who spoke very choppy English and I could barely understand her and she had no idea what I was talking about  I asked to speak to someone who could speak better English and I was put on HOLD for over 20 minutes  I called back and was once again put on HOLD  THIS IS NOT A GOOD DEAL AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS NIGHTMARE FOR ANYONE  JUST GO TO DAVE AND BUSTERS PERSONALLY OR DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IF YOU CANNOT GO PERSONALLY AND PICK THE CARDS UP  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON
__label__Positive	This is an easy way to give to grandchildren who like to shop on amazoncom  No postage and no tax

__label__Positive	great gift option
__label__Positive	Love the restaurant
__label__Positive	I had gift cards to use before they expired so putting the value on an Amazon card was the best use of the value
__label__Negative	Could not use it  and had a Hecck of a time with customer service
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly on retailers site Love being able to buy email giftcards on Amazon
__label__Negative	I need four purchases until I got the card
__label__Positive	Everyone loved the little box it came in
__label__Positive	excelente
__label__Positive	Having a gift card which can be sent by email is a lifesaver for last minute gifts Wish all my gift shopping was that easy Finished and delivered within ten minutes
__label__Positive	This was perfect for my sons birthday He had just emailed me about a GPS system that he wanted to buy on Amazon and asked if I would use the Amazon Gift Card as his birthday present I sent it immediately and he turned around and bought what he wanted immediately  Couldnt have been better

__label__Positive	We love this ecard
__label__Positive	Very cute and cozy My daughter loves it
__label__Positive	Cute affordable gift card for Christmas
__label__Positive	Convenient and always useful and appreciated

__label__Positive	Always great to get one of these Just like cash
__label__Positive	Very pleased with the availability to have a gift in a matter of minutes
__label__Positive	Printed gift card from my computer and it looked very professional and has already been spent and receiver enjoying the gift
__label__Positive	My sister loved it Thank U so much
__label__Positive	This gift card was for a wedding shower  Liked the idea bride  groom can use it for items they dont receive rather than having
duplicates  hassle with returning a gift  Bride was very pleased 
__label__Positive	The packaging was nicely done and I got it so quickly
__label__Positive	I ordered my granddaughter who is in college a gift card It arrived within a couple of days after placing order in a cute gift box I would definitely order another one Thanks
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an Amazon Gift Card
__label__Positive	Ordering was a breeze  Gift card was emailed to recipient within seconds of ordering  My newly grad was so happy to received it
__label__Positive	It was fun and easy to send to someone who lives far away and only she knows what she wants
__label__Positive	Gift Card is a great alternative for gifts anywhere in the country I recommend it I keep buying and gifting with gift card
__label__Positive	Amzon gift cards are great
__label__Negative	Sent the cardbut its NOT ACTIVE  Amazon is really going downhill fast Had nothing but trouble with this entire order and now this
__label__Negative	Awesomeleft on porch Great job Amazon Now I get to go through the whole return process  This is going to be interesting
__label__Positive	This is an ironic 5 stars  There is nothing to rate about a gift card  You use it to get something else  One day shipping didnt happen  It took a week  My nephew had no gift on his birthday
__label__Positive	Useful and I dont understand Why I have to write a review of a gift card what can I possibly say about a gift card   it is a card and a gift too
__label__Negative	Why would someone pay more then the card itself Whoever did buy this I dont feel sorry for them at all when they dont get the card or its comes with an invalid code because they were just stupidSCAM
__label__Positive	I do try to purchase gifts according to a recipients likes wants or needs  Sometimes the best give is a gift card  I appreciate the various designs available at Amazon for all occasions  This one is wonderfully festive for birthdays
__label__Positive	You do it again with being able to stay at home and accomplish so much  I bought it printed it and mailed it in same day  Perfect for the busy life and still so personal by mail rather than email
__label__Positive	Great present for my uncle since I forgot his birthday until the very day  He loves Olive Garden and I looked like a hero
__label__Negative	Lone star just closed a bunch of their locations so be careful buying this card
__label__Positive	thanks it couldnt have arrived at a better time
__label__Positive	We believed this card was stolen  We looked everywhere and can not find it  Can you find out has it been used  Feel very bad about the lost of the card   It was my husbands birthday present
__label__Negative	Why is this an addon Why do I need to spend 25 to have the ability to give Amazon gift cards to others These should be freebies What a marketing failure  You should be GIVING EVERYONE these flexible gift cards so they can use them on your site

Do not make me pay 25 in purchases to get them  Im a professional marketeer and this is just stupid Dont you know the analogy of razors to razor blades Give the razors for free and charge what you can for the razor blades  Now thats how Marketing works
__label__Positive	Everything went fine
__label__Positive	The gift card received a massive WOW from the receiver
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Negative	Did not print  I did get a refund
__label__Positive	Just what they said it would be 
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Neutral	Its alright kind of flimsy though and supereasy to do  Im not one for puzzles but I had to open it in order to get the card in it  It only took me about 30 seconds to get it open  It will hold a single gift card or one bill because the space available is very thin  If you want something fun for an adult then this probably isnt it  It would be good for younger kids maybe 7 years old and younger
__label__Positive	For congratulations and to continue to inspire a young girl to continue to read and read  she found her favorite authors and enjoyed
__label__Positive	We were looking for something different for a friends birthday and when we saw amazon had a gift card for the kindle it was just what we could use Very easy to obtain printed it out on the internet and gave it as a present all in the one day Great way to go
__label__Positive	It was Easy It was Fun It was Wonderful  I will be Purchaseing Gift Cards Again  You will Love them So Easy to Do
__label__Positive	I would highly recommend this product for people especially if you know that the other person has a kindel or likes to shop with Amazon
__label__Positive	Gift cards are slick especially when you just dont know what to get There are lots of designs to choose from
__label__Positive	I always purchase a 5000 for myself to purchase books on line its so convenient to do a quick purchase  Its like carrying a stash in your walletfor emergency
__label__Positive	nice Christmas present
__label__Positive	So fast and easy My niece loved it
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	It was awesome got here thanks
__label__Positive	This was the perfect way for me to send a gift to my granddaughter in VA  She was thrilled to receive it

__label__Positive	I emailed this to a friend I play video games with He was very happy with his birthday present
__label__Positive	Love the food and ease of using the e gift card
__label__Positive	Free with 200 dollar worth of Amazon gift card  Lovely Teddy Bear  Thanks Amazon

__label__Positive	Just what I ordered and really was ready for under the tree
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	I ordered this for a friend  I needed to mail it across the country I really did receive it the next day It was in an envelope and I removed that and the gift card was in a card and envelope I signed it and off it went within minutes My kind of shopping
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Amazing touch I will buy most gift cards through Amazon It was beautiful and the receiver is thrilled when the get it
__label__Negative	I inadvertently ordered 200 in gift cards unequivocally and honestly believing I was sending Amazon Gift Cards  We reside in a State that does not accept Bow Tie to Lend Credence  An admitted oversight on my part  My extensive history indicates the same to the same 3 folks each  year during certain times When I realized that I made this error as the recipients had not redeemed them I immediately contacted Amazon  Amazon representative said that there is not a thing they can do about it and I would have to go directly to Bow Tie Cinemas  I called Bow Tie Cinemas to no avail  I left a message and have not heard from them in weeks and as of this writing still no contact  Id written to them to no avail  Please Bow Tie Cinemas  REFUND ME  Please AMAZON assist further

__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Great Packaged well and looked crisp
__label__Positive	Very Good Service
__label__Negative	Dont order this card it doesnt work I tried using this card at Round Table and it didnt work Then amazon emailed me saying they sent me a card that didnt work Then they sent me another one then I went to a different Round Table and that card didnt work either
__label__Negative	Well I cant even find it so awful is my opinion When I bought it the first time Im not even certain it went through so I had to buy it again and then it says no products in cart no orders  I feel totally ripped off
__label__Positive	I was a little hesitant to order two 500 gift cards to be delivered to my door and also because of some of the reviews stating the little Santa boxes were bent  However I loved how these looked and a real card seems so much more gifty than the print yourself ones do  So I forged on and ordered  I was given a tracking number on the cards and they arrived safe and sound the very next afternoon as promised  My boxes were in pristine condition and they are as cute as can be  I would simply advise that you be home when your UPS man usually delivers the next day so they dont sit on your porch  Should they not arrive Amazon says to contact them immediately and I would assume they would void your numbers  I was very happy I ordered these
__label__Positive	excellent product

__label__Positive	Who doesnt like a gift card on Amazon
__label__Negative	I purchase many lowes GC to help procure building supplies for my business however my orders are recently being placed constantly on a 4 hour manual review Is this conducive for anyones business Furthermore why isnt the amazons business Dept open 247  I keep getting herded around like cattle between their Manila customer service and lackluster supervisor who just file AtoZ claims and tell me to wait Then that never call I have to literally call 810 times a day to get any kind of service that resembles a customer FIRST approach I wonder how Jeff Bezos would feel if he knew how impersonal many of his reps were and how many times they fail to resolve a business prime customers issue These 4 hour verifications are torture And extremely EXCESSIVE Is it ACIs fault whos to blame for this constant blockage and congestion Can I complete an order around here or do we have to babysit and hold every orders hand through the system

Jeff Bezos help Im going insane Every day Im calling care for some nonsense

__label__Positive	It  arrived exactly as advertised The quality was very nice Thumbs up

__label__Negative	I finally got around to using this only to find out that there are NO FUNDS loaded onto the card Yes I received a gift card with 0 when it should have been 50 I tried applying it to an online order and when no funds showed up I assumed it was a problem with their site so I placed my order anyway and I contacted American Eagle with the gift card  and they said the funds would be returned to my credit card so once I received their confirmation I threw out the card so I cant even call the number on the card to sort out this issue because I dont have it anymore And I cant find a link or contact button to reach the company PLEASE contact me so I can receive my funds for this card
__label__Positive	This card I bought for a friend She likes bagels
__label__Positive	We sent this as a thank you gift to a speaker who addressed our audience  It takes minutes to order and deliver rather than hours in choosing something and delivering in person or shipping to the recipient  I love Amazon  Best online shopping experience out there
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Got these for a Pug themed party and they did the trick
__label__Positive	Great for those last minute and hassle free birthday and other gifting for Amazon shoppers especially if its difficult to pick an item gift for someone I was able to easily customize the gift card by enclosing a photo I chose that meant something to the gift receiver  Amazon confirms your order and confirms when the gift receiver opens the email to acceptretrieve the gift card

__label__Positive	Not much to say about this I ordered it It showed up It worked when I needed it to
__label__Positive	Very cute looking and sturdy material Good deal
__label__Negative	Sorry and I new I shouldnt have done it but dummy me went ahead and ordered the card as payment to pycitycom for an applicance Within days pycity was off the internet and my money was gone Been buying on the internet for years and this was my first dumb and I mean dumb move Impulse to save was greater than common sense
__label__Positive	When you dont know what to give this is great  Every one loves to receive this  I like it too
__label__Positive	I gave these out and they cant wait to go
__label__Positive	but spends just the same  I will not buy from Amazon next time if need in a hurry will pick up at a store

__label__Positive	Looked great
__label__Positive	fast delivery and card worked
__label__Positive	I used the bd gift card with 200 attached for my my granddaughter who turned 13 yrs Old while living living in South Korea while her father teaches at an university there  She said she absolutely loved the gift
My son sent me an absolutely darling animated bd card with money attached to it which I spent quickly   that is what gave me the idea to send one to my oldest grand daughter 
I highly recommend using the gift cards  It saves on the high rate of mailing
I would like to see more cute animated cards to choose from  My youngest grand daughters bd is in a few months
__label__Positive	GREAT GIFT AND MUCH APPRECIATED
__label__Positive	good
__label__Negative	I ordered a Amazon gift card for my Mother for Mothers day and it was to be delivered electronically via email She never mentioned getting the present so after a couple of days I asked her if she got it She said no she had never received it  I had to go back online to Amazon and have it resent It worked the 2nd time around but I was disappointed that she didnt get a gift on Mothers Day

__label__Positive	great way to get gift cards
__label__Positive	I purchase several gift cards for others for all types of holidays I have also received Amazon gift cards as gifts and have never had a problem redeeming the cards or having them arrive to the intended recipient on time These are easy to use and apply to your Amazon account They allow the recipient to gift themselves something that they want versus receiving something they have to return or regift
__label__Positive	Wonderful for a gift certificate for a man
__label__Positive	Gift arrived on time Grandson delighted with his gift
__label__Positive	I have found I am giving your gift certificates more frequently as my three sons and two inlaw children are all over thirty and have very specific desires and Amazon has always met their needs Thank you
SueN
__label__Positive	Very very quick as always I recommend that for all people who want to send a gift online 100 recommended
__label__Positive	My dad has a Kindle and is as voracious a reader as I am  I really liked being able to get him a Kindle gift certificate online because then it could go directly into his Amazon account instantaneously and I didnt have to worry about the card getting lost or stolen and Dad can download books whenever he feels like it  Im actually very glad for these online gift cards  Dad thought it was a great birthday present
__label__Positive	Perfect for a birthday gift
__label__Positive	I bought this as a gift for my mother It was simple to buyeasy to use even for someone who is not tec savy She loved it it opened up a new door for her to buy more than just books from amazon
__label__Positive	Great Great gift the fact how it comes in a tin can all decorated up it awesome in its own Dont need to wrap it or anything  Looks cool and makes it look special
__label__Positive	We got this for a birthday and went out with my mother and sister  Everyone enjoyed the food particularly the salad bar  There is a good selection of side dishes including sweet potato fries and roasted white cheddar brussel sprouts with bacon sauce  The steak salmon and shrimp entrees were good but not as outstanding as the salad bar  Our 8 year old ordered steak and shrimp with sides of salad bar and sweet potato fries  She got a to go box and had three meals out of it  As everyone had salad bar we had no room for all of our food  So all got to go boxes and had no room for dessert  We had no trouble using the card
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	You may not really appreciate quickly emailing a gift card until run across a merchant that supplies only plastic cards that are sent via US mail

__label__Positive	Much easier than sending gift card
__label__Negative	This is not a review of Starbucks I love Starbucks However this listing is deceiving How do you mail me a digital code to redeem I might as well just bought the physical gift card I was expecting a code to redeem through email To the seller you need to be clear that this is a code that will be mailed to you

__label__Positive	As expected Really can use at WFM
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	I have a friend who is graduating sometime within the few weeks so I bought her this giftcard as part of her gift I know its not necessarily tradition to just gift graduates with giftcards but I knew it was something she would use and probably already has used up She told me at least half of her monthly paycheck goes into coffee at Starbucks and I just knew I had to help her out with this giftcard My only complaint is that it doesnt come in smaller denominations I felt 25 was a lot to spend on just coffee but I really like her and it was worth it
__label__Positive	WONDERFUL GIFTS WHEN YOU DONT KNOW WHAT TO BUT
__label__Negative	I bought this because my sister loves audible and didnt have a specific book she wanted When she tried to use it she wasnt allowed I am dumbfounded they arent compatible Im sure shell use it but I am still upset

__label__Positive	Cute Of course shipping awesome
__label__Neutral	I purchased an Amazoncom gift card for my sisters Birthday  As she lives in Europe and I live in the US I felt that Email delivery would be the safest way to send the gift card  Well she never received the Email gift card despite my resending it and also having Amazoncom Customer Service resend it  Finally I had Customer Service Email me the gift card and I forwarded it to her in an email message
__label__Positive	The order was shipped and delivered quickly greeting card  envelope attached with the gift card wasnt bent or damaged in anyway The greeting card is very nice quality Would order again

__label__Negative	Purchased a gift card for 100 for my husbands birthday and it did not give him 100 to use when he ordered stuff on line Phoned Amazon and they couldnt explain why this happed so he lost about 37 worth of spending money Will not order a gift card again

__label__Positive	Great Package
__label__Positive	OK
__label__Positive	These just arrived today to be used as part of a graduation giftThese boxes are SO nice for either male or femalethe polka dots are circled with iridescent metallic so the bling will make the girls happy and colors just seem fit for a guyIm excited about how often I can give them outthe boxes are good sizedlike a ladies watch jewelry size  measuring 4 x 4 of sturdy paper  cardboardquality  I also like the fact you can add any amount to the card
__label__Positive	My family loves getting Amazon gift cards  They are across the country from us and it is so nice to know they will get what they want
__label__Positive	Looks nice Arrived on time No complaints 
__label__Positive	Great idea for a grad
__label__Positive	Like it On time instantaneously
__label__Positive	I was sick during holidays and couldnt get out to shop so the Amazon gift card solved the problem  My daughterinlaw has already used hers
__label__Positive	very convenient and helpful all my friends like it very much 
__label__Positive	Great gift I use them routinely
__label__Negative	Dont buy this card at all cost  Our card didnt  work as we couldnt  activate it  We called Apple bee they said they cannot do anything we called amazon they said it was Apple fault Now we are battling for hours to get either a card which works or at least the money back  after hours spending solving it Dont buy it please  You will pay for it

After checking further with Apple Bees they informed that the card was already used In Texas while I live in New Jersey That company selling those cards are a SCAM  Watch out do not buy and check the negative reviews  If you dont use it immediately your credit will be stolen  Do not TRUST AMAZON as they wont do anything for itI spent more than few K USD with them last year and do not help in anyways for 40 Dollars which has been stolen by that third party scam  USELESSS
__label__Positive	I loved how convenient it is to give a gift which can give hours of enjoyment to someone who loves reading
__label__Positive	The photo uploaded with no problems and my mom was thrilled see her kids on her birthday gift card Thanks for this new feature
__label__Positive	this is a great idea for kids in collegeonly problem is that sometimes it ends up in their spam mail I had that happen and they re sent the item glad I gave my college daughter a heads up that it was on its way otherwise she would not have known that she received a gift
__label__Positive	I sent this to my brother along with a fandango card Its a great gift because who doesnt like coffee and you can find one anywhere
__label__Negative	I too have had the same experience as one of the previous reviewer ie ultra slow delivery i purchased a gift card for print last night about 730 pm PDT  I waited for 20 mins after purchase and no email showed up I finally gave up and left for my party

Then I found that the gift card approval email arrived  3 am today PDT Totally unacceptable

Another item Id like to point out is that I cannot cancel on the web pages Amazon had an email link that showed up when I placed the order for cancellation but I can no longer find it after the purchase Only option is to call it in I do not have the patience to deal with customer support individuals on the phone So I will probably use this card myself  if possible

Buyer beware

 Previous reviewer AMHs review cut and pasted here 
I have used this product feature before with no problems  edited 
I do think these printable gift cards are a great idea and have been happy with them in the past I dont know what happened that made my instant order take over an hour this time but it will definitely make me think twice before using this product next time My recommendation to anyone who uses it in the future will be Dont wait until the last minute I find this sad because that is supposed to be the beauty of the thing Oh well I hope it was just a onetime fluke Good luck

__label__Positive	All good bday gift was recvd

__label__Negative	The gift card was not activated It was a gift to my dad in Fathers Day and when he went to pay at the restaurant he was told there was no balance on the card

__label__Positive	Very cute cupcake tin FUN way to enclose a gift card
__label__Negative	I decided to buy a printable Amazoncom gift certificate to go in a greeting card and regret the entire experiecne  Amazon makes you jump through extra hoops for security making it hard to print

Next time Ill buy something else
__label__Positive	Came in mail fast cute box
__label__Positive	Everithing OK
__label__Positive	The recipients were delighted

__label__Positive	Cant go9 wrong with Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift when you dont know what to get for the hardest person to shop for DAD

__label__Positive	Received the card in a timely fashion and gave it as a Christmas present The recipient was happy with it
__label__Positive	Cant wait to give to my daughter for XmasShes never been there
__label__Positive	It is what it is A gift card with 25 credit in it Not 26 not 24 You get what you pay for
__label__Positive	Easy and fast
__label__Negative	The worst usb charger I have even seen  It does not work

Even if it works this usb charger is missing all these basic features

1  it does not have any indicator to show that it is charging your phone when you connect it to a phone or mobile device

2  Assuming that it is charging your phone it does not have indicator to show it is in progress or it has ended either fully charge done
or it lost power to proceed further

3  there is no indicator to show capacity

4  there is no switch or button or any indicator to tell you what you are doing or what it is doing or not doing

5  the only light is red when charging and green after full charged when connected to power source Still seeing green light
does mean the charger would work  see below

6  a fully charged charger with green light shown when connected to power source  Not after  You wont see any indicator later does not mean it would charge your phone  How ironic

7  No technical support at least for the issues I faced above

8  By luck if you charge this charger a few times repeatedly you might be able to use it once
But then you might have to repeat this whole process

9  All these effort for a 2250mAh charger if it works
__label__Positive	Convenient and easy
__label__Negative	I got a giftcard for my hard to shop for father on his birthday He hasnt seen it in his email nor have I had confirmation where it was sent to Not real happy

__label__Positive	As the previous reviewer stated a great quality about this card is that it can be used at multiple and not to forget delicious restaurants  What we learned the hard way was not to depend on that guaranteed shipping date  It isnt always so guaranteed  YIKES

__label__Positive	Great for a gift
__label__Positive	Its nice to get these with a small note This is a nice way to send employees rewards for their efforts  Thank you
__label__Positive	Face it gift cards are convenient generally appreciated by the recipient and carry a high level guilt penalty  To many it says I was not
  1 industrious enough to ACTUALLY shop for your present
  2 creative or involved enough to shop for that personal perfect gift for you
  3 did not think you were worth the effort of actually shopping for or
  4 I got stuck with your name at the offices SECRET SANTA name draw
  5 this was worth no more than five minutes of my time and was done at the very last second

Given the above it was a nicely designed email present

__label__Positive	I didnt know what to give my daughterinlaw for her birthday and they live out of town I knew she loved to shop Amazon so this gift card was a winner
__label__Neutral	The gift cards are nice but I would like to be able to apply to an order when I want to not have the gift card applied automatically I have a sister who shares my account and she also got a gift card I have a subscription of coffee and the gift cards were applied automatically Whent that happens we have to keep track of the amount of our cards to use individually Could solve this if we can choose when to apply gift card or when to charge to cr cardshould be our choice

__label__Positive	Such an easy gift
__label__Positive	Second time giving as a gift Who doesnt love a amazon gift card
__label__Positive	I blame myself I really should have paid closer attention I accidentally bought the Iraqi Dinar Rubios Card on a lightning deal rather than the US dollar equivalent The good news is that they will probably revalue the Dinar in the next few years although they have been saying that for 10 plus years now Good news is whenif they do Revalue my 25 gift card will be worth 31 Million US dollars and I will then be able to open my own Rubios next to my home You really have to love those fish tacos
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Thanks

__label__Negative	I hope nobody else goes through the horrible experience at Amazomcom What a hassle I received a Burger King gift card that was demagnetized I tried to use it and their was such a hassle The Burger King cashier tried to use it in 3 different cash registers and had no success Although the total for 25 dollars appeared the card would not go through And this item is not eligible for return I wasted 25 dollars at At Amazoncom
__label__Positive	I liked that it came with card Great delivery time Didnt like that it was just left in my mailbox
__label__Positive	I ordered five different egift cards for my grandchildren for Valentines Day and was very pleased  They were delivered promptly which was a bonus because I waited until the last minute to purchase them  Very happy overall with egift cards from Amazon
__label__Positive	
__label__Positive	Was a gift
__label__Positive	Amazon always making things easy Thanks
__label__Positive	The Gift Box solves the problem of how to wrap a gift card without telling the world that there is a card inside  However with the cutout on the back of the box that no longer holds true since you can see the Gift Card through the cutout To get around that we placed a large Christmas To and From stickum label over the opening

The Gift Box works well if you hand it to someone but the postage gets to be expensive if it is necessary to mail the box separately
__label__Negative	I sent this to a friend in need who walked an hour to the nearest Safeway only to have the employees simply refuse to redeem it SafewayAmazon simply stole my money I paid for a completely worthless item Having this available is a scam
__label__Positive	The easiest way to send a gift ever and so cute and fun for kids to receive
__label__Positive	Nice gift card in a nice box
__label__Positive	if you are like me you forget every important date in your lifelike my Moms Bday sorry Mom being able to email my mom a giftcard was so nice not only did she get it on time for her bday it didnt look like i had forgotten to get her a bday gift i live in utah and mom lives in cali so it also saved me the trouble of having to ship something to her

__label__Positive	Whats easier or better than a gift card from Amazon
__label__Positive	Easy Process  Great last minute gifts
__label__Positive	It was a quick and convenient transaction I would recommend this as a gift to all the ebook readers out there
__label__Positive	I would buy this gift card for the packaging

__label__Positive	Family loves shopping with Amazon
__label__Positive	Outstanding
__label__Positive	Great option for gift
__label__Negative	My wife and I received a Kindle gift card from my daughter to download books for our Kindles

CAN NOT DO IT

The first person who uses the card owns it What No more presents to Mom and Dad

Very strange because I can use HER CREDIT CARD to buy an item

So now I have too many books and she has nothing  What a waste
__label__Positive	Very easy to do and the person loved it
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	These were for my niece and nephew kids I dont see them enough to now all the things they like so these are great because they have a wide variety of things to buy

__label__Positive	Order one for my daughterinlaw every year
__label__Positive	Ordered this for my husband I was leery after reading some bad reviews about ordering gift cards from Amazon Needless to say we had no problems and used it right away
__label__Positive	Have received photos of them enjoying their Starbucks
__label__Positive	A gift card was a great purchase because it allows my sister to buy anything she likes or needs  It is that simple
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Negative	I love Amazon so this is just a product review of my experiences with gift cards  I have given three gift cards at different times to different people for different from Amazon  In all three cases the note that I attached wishing them a happy birthday or congratulations did not end up in the gift card package  In all three cases they had no idea who it was from  They got it on time but were puzzled as to who gave it to them  There was no note  I really would love for this to work out better but I cant keep using this if they have no idea who it is from
__label__Negative	Bar code did not print properly from Edge browser  Was unable to redeem Had to go back home and reprint from Chrome before I could use Big hassle
__label__Positive	Fun tin for gift card gifts
__label__Positive	It works
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Great little Im thinking of you for childten
__label__Positive	Its a gift card Cute

__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift card  It worked
__label__Positive	Very cute and colorful 
__label__Positive	ALL GOOD
__label__Positive	Perfect card and so easy to send My dad loved it
__label__Negative	the gift card was lost as theyre not available on the Australian website and the US website kept automatically transferring me to the Australian site where I couldnt redeem it
__label__Negative	On the back of the gift card it says you cant use this for Family plans and you cant see this fine print on this Amazon page Bait and switch scam here
__label__Positive	Works

__label__Positive	I did receive a holiday gift card for Buca but it doesnt look like the picture as advertised Not a wreath Not a big deal but just something to note if you plan to buy this card  I purchased this as a gift so I was hoping for the more minimalistic design that was advertised

__label__Negative	We are new Amazon shoppers Unfortunately a couple of the clothing items did not fit Since they were not Prime items my wife has had difficulty obtaining reimbursement for the returned items As a result of the 100 I spent on her gift certificate Only 60 ended up being used The other 40 was unfortunately spent on seemingly nonreturnable items As a result we will not be purchasing a gift certificate again And will stick to Prime merchandise
__label__Positive	This is aways a welcomed gift
__label__Positive	Worked out perfectly

__label__Positive	When you are dealing with relatives who are interested in all kinds of things an Amazon Gift Certificate fits the bill
__label__Negative	This was a Christmas gift When I ordered this card I was told the estimated Delivery Date was 122313  On 122413 I received a text verification that said the item was on a carrier vehicle  out for delivery  and should be delivered on that same day  On 122613 I received another text saying that the card wasnt delivered until the day after Christmas  This card was sent to a man whose wife just died on 112213 Hes an older gentlemen with a teenage daughter and their finances are in a shambles after his wifes illness I was hoping this card could have been used for their Christmas Eve meal  Another item ordered under the same order number at the same time was actually delivered on the 24th even though I had received two text alerts telling me that item was not likely to arrive until after Christmas due to carrier delivery issues I had initially received a text saying that gift was on the truck out for delivery on 122313 Five minutes later I received a text informing me of carrier issues and saying that item wouldnt be delivered until after Christmas It was delivered on 122413 Alls well that ends well I guess

__label__Positive	bien
__label__Positive	Nice presentation  Quality packaging  A pleasure to give
__label__Positive	Gift cards from Amazon fit a variety of people and needs  They are very individualized  I recommend them to anyone

__label__Positive	Gift Cardwhat more can I say Loved the snowflake tin it came in
__label__Positive	Its a card to dominos not much else to be said
__label__Positive	This was the coolest containerboxgift card holder I purchased for gifts this Christmas  However it came damaged and was too late to return  Not sure if it came from Amazon damaged or was damaged in shipping as it arrived in a lightlypadded envelope  So future buyers beware that this is a cheap tin and can damage easily  Other than that any amazon gift card is great in my opinion
__label__Positive	Beautiful packaging

__label__Positive	When you cant be there for someones birthday and you know they really want something on Amazon this is by far the best and fastest way to put money toward their selection admit it sending a little bit of money toward a big ticket item is a better option than shelling out all the dough for it

__label__Negative	card didnt work was not activated properly

__label__Positive	I moved away from Massachusetts 10 years ago and always make a point to dine here every time I go home I always have a great meal A great place to go with family and friends I wish this restaurant was nationwide as it is far superior to TGI Fridays and Applebees  In addition to the great local New England restaurants I recommend you trying the 99 as well
__label__Positive	Perfect for my cousins twins

__label__Negative	This egift card did not work  I tried really hard to find a Target ecard or a Vons ecard and even after calling Amazon I kept getting cut off and when I finally did speak to someone I was told that you do not sell Target or Visa gift cards which can be used anywhere  This was a Fathers Day gift for my son in law and he wasnt able to use it

Please credit my account for 50 and cancel out this egift card as Vons stores do not accept the Safeway gift cards as I was originally told

__label__Positive	Great  for gifts to girl friends and or family Will be using these again very very soon Super awesome great
__label__Positive	I love Amazon gift cards because most people I buy gifts for hate what I buy them and unapologetically return every single gift So instead of saying buy your own gift Im sick of wasting my time its like saying I want you to be happy and pick out something you love from me and I always include one of their nice gift cards which you can personalize with your own picture making a face like youre so annoyed but happy birthday anyway

__label__Positive	This experience was excellent I just printed it off and gave it as a Christmas gift
__label__Positive	I loved this book  The way the author develops the two main characters is thoughtful and engaging revealing each over time one through stories told about them and the other by how those stories impacted him
__label__Positive	Excellent Gift Very Happy
__label__Positive	Does what it says on the brochure
__label__Positive	I always love ordering amazon cards as gifts It takes the guess work out of getting a gift for someone and the person can get just what they want
__label__Positive	It was a gift and she loved it
__label__Negative	The fee for the gift card was very high Bought a 20 gift card and paid 26 for it
__label__Positive	easy breeze to use or buy

__label__Positive	This is a great way to give a gift to friends and relatives living a distance  no international shipping hassle etc
__label__Negative	Safeway needs to have a printed copy which makes it difficult
__label__Positive	In a pinch dont know what to get or just a lazy shopper works great Prints nice too
__label__Negative	I ran into this last Christmas when I received a Spotify gift card and found that I could not add it to pay my ongoing monthly fee  The gift cards can only be used when setting up a new Spotify account  Eventually I sold the gift card to a friend that did not have Spotify Many other reviews are saying the same thing  The packaging is very misleading  I have always enjoyed Spotify but do not understand why they handle gift cards this way
__label__Positive	how can you not love a gift card Arrived when it should of
__label__Positive	Initially I used my credit card for purchases  After discovering the gift card I have removed the credit card and buy gift card of limited amount when I need them  The big advantage  safety  If something happens I only loose the remaining value in the card

It is really a bleeze purchasing card and redeeming the value  And it is nice to give myself a present
__label__Positive	Easy to use and buy  Set when you want the card to be delivered and it is sent right on time  
__label__Positive	You choose your own card so you should like it
__label__Positive	Arrived on time  BJs is a favourite of my American buddys
__label__Positive	Right on time
__label__Positive	Nice option to have for those last minute gifts  With the holidays coming up I ordered a couple 3 packs so I am ready for that unexpected guest which always seems to happen  I havent used them yet and will update more after I do  Nice option to have on hand  Highly Recommend
__label__Positive	For my nephews birthday who lives in Africa I found what he neededcapacity to buy the stuff that only he knew he needed  I customized it with a picture of his dad and him and it become more  than a gift card Thanks for making that possible
__label__Positive	Easy great gift Can be applied to anything Amazon Sent to soldier overseas What else can I say about a gift card
__label__Positive	gotta love BJs
__label__Positive	Christmas Gift but was easy and got here fast
__label__Positive	Easy to use  Bought a much needed humidifier which was on sale  Still had a good portion of the card left to use  Makes a great gift

__label__Positive	Best way to give a gift
__label__Positive	My daughter thought it was the coolest gift
__label__Positive	SUPER
__label__Positive	Bought it for my boyfriend for his Birthday
__label__Positive	Very easy to print and give With all of the products Amazon carries it just makes sense to give an Amazon gift card Will definitely do this again
__label__Positive	Convenient
__label__Positive	This Amazon Card is very precious and the new mom got so delighted with it because she was able to order all the most needed items for this
new baby a Gift from God
These gift cards are very useful because you never know what the other person needs the most and you dont even have to leave your home to purchase it  I highly recommend these gift cards
__label__Positive	Just upload your messageimage and its a bit more personal when the individual receives it Would recommend to anyone that uses Amazons services
__label__Positive	The presentation of the gift card was perfect for an unknown gender baby shower  gift
__label__Positive	This is a frequent gift for teens and anyone else in my family who needs a last minute gift  Best gift ever for this
__label__Negative	I never received this gift card  Theyre refunding my order but at this point its too late to reorder in time for this weekends Christmas party where this was to be a Secret Santa gift  I will buy another but I will have to print it at home and it will look really cheesy compared to having an actual gift card
__label__Positive	great Christmas gift
__label__Positive	Very cute
__label__Negative	You think the easiest thing in the world is to buy digital music ebooks and movies no postage costs and easy fast delivery  But no you have to be an American to buy digital music and movies And you need a kindle before you can buy an ebook  No wonder people download things illegally  If you are not American I would not recommend this site  Sorry
Please let me know if amazon becomes more accessible to other countries ie digital music ebooks that can be read as pdf etc and movies
__label__Positive	They loved it
__label__Positive	It is what was expected
__label__Positive	Perfect give for a recent college grad moving to his first apartment away from home Hell be able to pick whatever he needs Nice
__label__Positive	so many options if not for a romantic dinner at home or wanting to try something new The gift was perfect they could goto the local store or buy online with so many options from Steak to Fish
__label__Positive	I purchased this Gift Card for my secret Santa at work  It arrived quickly and was in great shape upon arrival  It was a great gift and the Santa tin was perfect
__label__Neutral	When I printed out card part of the claim number was missing
__label__Positive	The giftee always loves Amazon cards  What a great birthday gift
__label__Positive	Great deal  I bought these because my office was hosting families for the holidays  These are super soft fluffy bears  And Ill spend the gift card for sure
__label__Positive	I recently purchased a gift card for a retiree It was last minute  the lady loves her kindle She loved the gift card so she could purchase books
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Positive	I love AMC  It is my goto choice for movie theaters in my area  I go to a lot of movies and I always try to find gift cards at a discount  Even better a few months ago they started accepting AMC Gift Cards on the Fandango iOS App so I get a discount and preordered tickets for every move I go to no ticket fee if you are a AMC Stubs member

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card When you are buying a gift card for yourself it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20 off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal
__label__Positive	Fine it served the purpose for a quick and easy gift card if youre running late with organising gifts and cards The print colours seemed a bit wishywashy but that may be my printer
__label__Positive	The gifts cards were extremely easy to purchase printed well for inclusion in a card and well received by the recipients
__label__Positive	Cant say anything bad about this Fast simple and easily done
__label__Positive	Fantastic
__label__Positive	When I can give Amazon 20 and get 25 to take myself and hubby out to lunch how can I complain  The seasonal shakes are always great but Ive never had a bad shake there  Consider splitting one  By the time you eat the regular size burger and fries definitely not supersized half of a milkshake provides the perfect sweet touch to end your meal
__label__Positive	I absolutely love the ease and simplicity of the email delivery
 I love not having another bill Also I dont have to keep a credit card on file Being blind I appreciate not having to worry if it will get compromised in a hacking
 The email was easy to understand With very clear instructions Thanks Amazon and Netflix
__label__Positive	A good way to give a gift
__label__Positive	why dont ypu send me one for free
__label__Positive	Cute card
__label__Positive	I love to use these because they are such a help to teachers They are always glad to get them and I dont waste money trying to guess what might be useful for their classroom I love to stuff the bus with school supplies but I also love to make sure that the teacher has all the latest and greatest to teach the children I recommend them to anyone
__label__Positive	So nice to be able to share the Amazon shopping experience with friends and family
__label__Positive	Loved it thanks
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Talk about choices
__label__Positive	Gift Card worked fine at the restaurant
__label__Positive	A great online gift
__label__Positive	Delivers in 5 mins
__label__Positive	Why wouldnt I I mean it was a discount on cash
__label__Positive	Great case with gift card  loved it
__label__Negative	When buying the egift card I tried using it but it didnt work and kept showing up as invalid
__label__Positive	Very fast service
__label__Neutral	All good but the card email gets to the Spam folder of the receipent so they only found it when I told them about it no surprise effect   Maybe Amazon could finetune their email server settings to make emails more trusted by spam filters
__label__Positive	It made a nice gift and arrived very quickly
__label__Neutral	It was ok
__label__Positive	Love Amazon Gift Cards for those who have very particular tastes
__label__Positive	My daughterinlaw who lives across the country has a kindle and the Amazon Kindle email gift card was such an easy efficient way to send something that I knew she would like since she would choose her own reading material
__label__Negative	I requested a message be included on each greeting card that accompanied the gift card which was on the packing slip but none of the greeting cards had the message  According to packing slip each card had each persons name on it which was not on the card so I cant tell if Im giving the correct card to the correct person or if it even matters  Very unclear and not personalized as supposed to be Disappointing
__label__Positive	easy way to buisness and last minute holiday or birthday purchases Looked and was deliverd exactly like promised Thanks a  lot
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	During a holidaytime Lightning Deal we spent 40 on this 50 gift card and we used it with ease at our local IHOP restaurant Great experience
__label__Positive	I found this gift to be thoughtful and smart Since I am already an Amazon shopper the card came in handy
__label__Positive	Went down well
__label__Positive	This is gift is very nice Really easy to use arrives fast and very convenient This product is great and innovative Thanks
__label__Positive	This is not an Amazon issue but a Boscovs issue  Ive used these cards several times at their website with no problem  If however you try to use it at the physical store the register rejects it and the cashiers do not know how to resolve the problem  That was my personal experience
__label__Positive	perfect thank you gift for inlaws even though i had to purchase two separate cards for 75 equivalancy
__label__Positive	Easiest gift cards in the worldmakes saying thank you easy and offers so many choices for the recipient
__label__Neutral	These particular gift cards have no value until activated by a Starbucks cashier The recipient will need to have it activated the first time they use it To do this they will need to take the gift card to Starbucks in the tamperproof gift card holder that comes with it The activation information is on the gift card holder If you remove the gift card from the holder and just give the card to your recipient they will not be able to get the card activated and it will have no value I almost made this mistake I removed the gift card from the card holder and put it in a decorative box Then I realized the card needed to be activated I didnt have time to buy a new gift card so I had to give the recipient the card and the ripped card holder and explain my stupid mistake I was quite embarrassed But at least the card can be activated now I definitely wont make this mistake again Hopefully others can learn from my experience and avoid the embarrassment I went through
__label__Positive	Great service with a cool choice of card designs and Gift Card sent and delivered almost instantly
__label__Positive	The gift card arrived within a week and appears to have worked properly  Not sure what else to say but I have to put something here to fill up the required word count
__label__Positive	The Sunshine and Flowers Birthday gift card I sent my friend made her very happy  I will definitely do it again
__label__Positive	This is a great way to give birthday presents It lets the receiver pick out what they really like I gave it to my daughter in law for her birthday that way she could decide exactly what she was looking for
__label__Positive	Big hit
__label__Positive	Ideal gift card decor

__label__Positive	My niece received her gift card in her email very quickly
__label__Positive	I was given a generous Amazon gift card for Christmas which came in the mail  It was beautifully packaged in a nice gift box and ribbon  Redeeming it was a breeze and I am very happy with the process and especially with what I bought  This was my first Amazon gift card and I would definitely consider this as a gift for someone else

__label__Positive	Had a little fun getting this transferred to my Bucks account Had to activate it first which created another card in my account and then transfer to my primary card No direct transfer Still its all good
__label__Positive	never knew that I could get gift cards hit
__label__Negative	This item is a piece of junk It does not work with any game plus the controller goes in any direction except for the direction you want I sent it back a month ago and they received it but still no refund Stay away from this company
__label__Positive	Came just as expected Cute little card
__label__Positive	The credit for the sender expires in January This limitation should be removed for a 5  rating Overall a nice way to make a quick gift
__label__Positive	It was perfect
__label__Positive	It was so convenient to send and to individualize with any photo The recipient was thrilled to use it for a purchase he wanted
__label__Positive	The website was a little confusing at first as Ii wanted to email the gift certificate as well as print it out  sometimes Im not too bright but I never did figure out how to do both at the same time  Otherwise the recipient got the certificate and I got an email saying when it was received  I would do this again
__label__Negative	Was not easy to use had to cancel and request refund wouldnt print
__label__Negative	What a horrific deal I bought a 50 giftcard during a lightning deal for 40 I had a specific hotel in mind that I wanted  when I tried to book it it said I could only use it on pay now hotels Well I was paying now it was a nonrefundable room To use the giftcard I had to book it as a refundable room increasing the price 20 There was only one other hotel in the area I could use the giftcard for and it was a dump

I called thinking surely someone at hotelscom could help me I called hotelscom They transferred me to their giftcard distributer who said they dont make bookings and transferred me to hotelscom again I could barely understand this guy and he tried to get me to book and THEN be transferred to customer service We were almost through booking and he wanted my credit card number I refused unless he could guarantee theyd apply the giftcard after the fact he said he couldnt but could transfer me to customer service So the fourth lady said that she could not help me either but could transfer me back to the giftcard people who Id already spoken to Pulling my hair out and wishing Id never bought the damn card Going to try to sell it and cut my losses

NEVER DOING BUSINESS WITH HOTELSCOM AGAIN Back to travelocity where they at least have good customer service
__label__Positive	Always a great gift card
__label__Positive	its good
__label__Positive	Got this for our daughters teacher during teacher appreciation week she goes to the movies a lot she loved it It was simple to purchase and super convenient  something she enjoyed No hassle Will definitely keep in mind for future too Highly recommend

__label__Positive	Simply Super animation
__label__Positive	What can I really say about an Amazon gift certificate It ships quickly and in a lovely presentation box If youve forgotten about a birthday until the day of you can send one via email which weve done many times But if you remember and have a couple days then this is a nice way to ship the certificate

__label__Positive	Works just fine for me The server said there was something wrong like the other reviewers but it turned out that she was putting the card info in as a coupon and not a gift card It took a manager to do it but it was cleared
__label__Positive	This is one of the most thoughtful gifts I received   100 of sheer happiness I enjoyed reading my favourite authors and since there was no deadline for the voucher I could leisurely download books as and when I felt like it  I was so sad when it got over that bought myself another gift voucher Great idea amazon thanks
__label__Positive	GIFT FOR SISTERS WIDOWED MOTHER IN LAW THEY CAN HELP HER AQUIRE ITEMS OF HER CHOICE VERY HELPFUL
__label__Positive	The photo came out well and it was fun to personalize the gift card
A nice way to make a gift card less businesslike

__label__Positive	Glad its available to give as a gift  It made my friend very happy indeed to get a surprise 
__label__Positive	Instant delivery
__label__Positive	What can I say They gave my fianceacute and his friend 50 at Hooters after an out of town full scenario paintball game I ordered the actual cards and had no problem with authenticity They used them without any issues The free one day shipping for Prime members was awesome I had just had unexpected surgery and there was no way for me to leave the house to buy them They showed up right in time
__label__Neutral	I wanted and it appeared that I would be able to use my Discover cashback bonus for this card  The card was 5000 and I had 9700 in my cash back bonus  I clicked for that to happen and thought it did but later found out that it didnt  That should have been stated at the time I was deciding whether to buy it or not
__label__Positive	Good Product
__label__Positive	Very easy to shop this way
__label__Positive	I chose the Nativity Scene Card as Jesus is the reason for the season Then I chose the plaid gift card box because I am of Scottish descent through my fathers paternal family I guess Im just sentimental
__label__Positive	This was fast  easy
__label__Positive	Perfect for a wedding birthday anniversary or Im just thinking of you gift
__label__Positive	Good buy worked as needed
__label__Positive	Thumbs up
__label__Positive	As expected

__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	So convenient
__label__Positive	Bought it as a birthday gift and it was perfect
__label__Negative	They should have mentioned in bold letters that you cant use at rest stops I drive cross country a lot and that was my intended use
__label__Positive	Its a great gift for any occasion My son really enjoyed it
__label__Positive	I got it
__label__Positive	These Amazon Gift Cards that you can print right off the website are the best  Especially for last minute gifts that you forgot to get over the holidays

Plus on Amazon you can buy anything
__label__Positive	Great and easy way to get someone special something
__label__Negative	cant utilise the voucher
__label__Positive	Great if youre using it on yourself but this isnt something youd want to order from amazon if youre giving it away as a gift Doesnt come with a gift card box its just shoved in a bubble envelope so itll arrive looking less than perfect But hey a gift card is a gift card As long as it has the right amount in it its all good
__label__Positive	Right on time and easy to use  Just all the other Amazon gift cards Ive bought
__label__Positive	What to give the soninlaw with everything This is IT
__label__Positive	What is more fun than a barrel of monkeys  Browsing on Amazon coffee in hand and with a gift card   Arrives quickly and everyone is happy
__label__Positive	Dont go on a weekend
__label__Positive	good thanks for offering these items because it lets you do your shopping when you really want does not expire because the quantity in I commend them for offering you products that make shopping easier since Im from Venezuela
__label__Positive	BETTER HAVE FUNDS ON IT I wont know until next week and if this goes unedited then funds were there but I have read enough gift card reviews that we are basically taking a CHANCE on these things and thats not freaking kool
__label__Positive	I love converting my Amazon gift card balance into these Safeway egift cards  They work just fine at my local Safeway store  It was a little tricky at first  The newer cashiers do not know how to use them so I just make sure to ask for a manager or pick a cashier that is a regular  has been working there for awhile  These really help out with my weekly grocery bills  I like the way it comes through my email within five minutes
__label__Positive	Worked great thanks Great Christmas present I love BuildABear

__label__Positive	She was happy to see gift card from Amazon
__label__Positive	Product was fine Only downside was that the delivery was left unattended on the porch
__label__Positive	The card was adorable and a good way of letting someone know you care even when you have no idea what to buy The gift card was well received and used for something he really needed and it was available on Amazon
__label__Positive	very nice
__label__Positive	Fun and easy
__label__Positive	It arrived in my inbox within fifteen seconds  Remember you need to print this out to use it in the store because you cannot save it to Bass Pro Shop phone app  The cashier will need to input the numbers so be prepare for angry glances as people wait behind you
__label__Positive	Great idea mom loved it
__label__Negative	Someone hacked my account and ordered the gift card Purchase was reversed by my bank
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for my niece and nephews

__label__Positive	Very convenient for me to send my daughter in vegas from sac
__label__Positive	my grandson loved it
__label__Positive	Whats not to like its a gift card  The little box is adorable
__label__Positive	I cant begin to tell you how much I love my Kindle and I am thrilled when someone gives me a gift card to buy books  I have trouble reading regular print so my Kindle is a godsend because of the adjustable font sizes I have recommended Kindle to all my friends and will continue to do so  Thank you
__label__Positive	Great to Gift your Friends  Coworkers 
__label__Neutral	The only problem with this product that I have is that the sticker note on the front of the card is too sticky that when I tried to remove it the sticker fell apart and some pieces were just left on the card and the sticky part is hard to remove The consequence is that I cannot send the card with this problem to anybody
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	This was easy to send to friend
__label__Positive	This was a gift to an elderly mother in another state  She has a Kindle and this was easy to send to her and she is enjoying reading books on her Kindle that she purcahsed with the gift card  Only shipping costs were the cost of a first rate stamp

__label__Positive	Was a birthday present no complaints he was happy with it
__label__Positive	Easy smooth and greatly appreciated
__label__Positive	Works as advertised Great Buy
__label__Positive	Decorative box and appreciated gift
__label__Positive	I love to give personalized gifts but when in doubt everyone loves an Amazoncom gift card You cannot go wrong Maybe not the most thoughtful gift to give but I know when Ive received them Ive aways been very pleased
__label__Positive	It was very easy to print and mail to the recipient
__label__Neutral	Took a long time to deliver to my email but when it got there it worked perfect
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	CHRISTMAS GIFT
__label__Positive	My soninlaws gavorite Christmas gift
__label__Neutral	Mark sure you buy in the receivers store as these do not cross over This can be a pain if for example buys on Amazoncom for someone in  the UK As it can only be cashed in the buyers store and the site directs you back to the home store it ends up being hard to use
__label__Neutral	ok purchase and delievery
__label__Positive	Very Good Product
__label__Positive	Arrived a day earlier than actual birthday for my niece However my personal note was not attached She assumed it was from me however since I had sent her previous ones on her birthday before Rob Wayne Hudack
__label__Positive	My brother absolutely loved this gift he enjoyed so much this fun card For this reason I recommended 100

Fast delivery I received the email confirmation as soon he got it

Thanks amazon for such a great gift card option
__label__Positive	recipient appreciated it
__label__Positive	whats to rate
__label__Positive	It worked out very well  It is better then sending cash through the mail
__label__Positive	Whats not to love about getting a discounted gift card for a place you know youll be going with a child or grandchild
__label__Positive	Gifts
__label__Negative	Well protected in bubble envelope that looked brand new but the tin container was dented anyway  It was obviously damaged before they sent it  In addition I paid for oneday delivery but it took over two days before arrival I hope that theres a card in the tin

A gift card should easily get 5 stars
__label__Positive	Quick response
__label__Positive	Great movie
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Quick Delivery Item EXACTLY as described AAAA
__label__Positive	exelent
__label__Positive	It was fast and easy
__label__Positive	Made a nice gift for granddaughter
__label__Positive	I was very happy that the gift card had the right amount of money on it  I read some reviews where the money amount was not the full amount  I noticed that ACI reviews were the positive ones and the mallgiftcard were the problem ones  I definitely recommend getting the gift cards as long as they are being shipped from ACI
__label__Positive	No surprises  Was easily used by the recipient
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	great
__label__Negative	I dont hate it I dont have it
__label__Positive	EASY PEASY
__label__Positive	Great Present

__label__Positive	A really convenient way to send someone you love a last minute gift for any holiday Great service by Amazon
__label__Positive	Arrived on time and works as a gift card should
__label__Positive	Very good prodecteasy usedeasy cleaning After use it one month my tee look like much white and I will buy one for my sister
__label__Positive	Very convenient
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	If you live in an area with AMC theaters and have an AMC Stubs membership Fandango convenience fees are waived  If your theater doesnt have this benefit dont buy this  The Amazon description should disclose the fee minus 1 star

While I would not normally buy this card at face value because Fandango often has discounts if bought directly as a Lightning Deal this is attractive because I save 20 plus 5 stars
__label__Positive	Not sure why I need to review the Amazon gift cards but for the presentation and free one day shipping it is the best in then business
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	I love this option Ive both sent and received this type of gift and love it I was pleased to see a Christmas theme that had a Christmas message Choosing the amount and sending to the recipient was easy Nice to be able to personalise it and to receive a message from the recipient
__label__Positive	My grandson called me the beast after getting an Amazon gift card for Xmas  Yes beast  not best  In case you are not up on your teenageeze that is a good thing
__label__Positive	This is always the right size and right color ONE SIZE FITS ALL
__label__Negative	Received the gift card and tried to use and it was declined Very disappointed
__label__Positive	Works great
__label__Positive	Got here in no time
__label__Positive	My great niece loved her gift card  shopping at Amazon was such fun for her Delivery time is so quick
__label__Positive	The holidays landed me with a visa gift card but what I needed cost more than that  So I simply purchased an amazon digital  gift card for myself amazon automatically applied it and I put the remainder on my card of choice
__label__Positive	Fast and easy when it comes to gift giving My recipients always love getting Amazon gift cards and I love giving them
__label__Positive	easy
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Tin was just as shown and of decent quality  Fun little box for trinkets etc
__label__Positive	The recipient was extremely fond of this gift I sent for her graduation She thought it clever and unique  a one of a kind and was excited to receive the Amazon gift card in the graduation cap box
__label__Positive	I forgot to send my dad something but I know he has a kindle He can buy what he wants to read
__label__Positive	A gift card always fits and you can rest assured that they havent read or seen it yet Can be delivered instantly
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a gift card 
__label__Positive	My friend loved his gift card The cupcake case that holds the gift card is very cute  I would buy this again for a gift to friends or family
__label__Positive	Can be improved with stylish design and more diversity of colors not just blue and green Lettering can also be improved
__label__Positive	Great gift idea for those who youre not sure what to get I received one for Christmas and before we were even done opening gifts I was already dreaming up what I was going to get with it then by the time I got onto Amazon I actually got a bit overwhelmed because I realized I could buy almost ANYTHING Great way to give someone something they wouldnt normally buy themselves but wouldnt ask for at the same time

__label__Positive	Great gift for all
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like a gift card for Christmas
__label__Positive	I had a young man help me with my order and my gift cards He was polite and very helpful I wish I had written down his name He is an asset to Amazon
__label__Positive	This makes for the perfect gift every single time I bought it for myself because I have no one in my life and was very lonely I decided to fill the void in my life by giving myself yet another way to surround myself with material stuff Im so vapid it hurts

__label__Positive	Its awesome and I love the gift card
__label__Negative	Be warned  You cannot use gift card balances to purchase future gift cards  I attempted to purchase a 75 gift card for a friend with my gift card balance which totaled over 200  I was forced to use a credit card to purchase it even though I had plenty in my gift card balance to cover it  I dislike this policy  Money should be money  But when Amazon gets a hold of your cash you wont be able to use it as cash
__label__Positive	Excelnt easy to use great great gift i love it send me more when ever you want  ypu pick your own gitf

__label__Negative	an empty plastic card has arrived
I was so embarrassed at the Nordstrom store
got a refund
__label__Positive	Great gift with the photo added a bit of fun
__label__Positive	It did work and sending speed is quick But be careful when you paste it to Applebees online order paymentit will not work because the number format  so I was scared at first time By entering the number will work
__label__Positive	My wife is a voracious reader and as such we have a tremendous amount of books in our house  We have a fairly large home but in no way shape or form do we have room for a library  As it is we have only one builtin bookshelf and it is full  Weve talked about selling our collection and the gift card only makes sense  We purchased the original Kindle a few years ago as a gift for her late mother but her eyesight got worse and she rarely used it  Now it will come to life and serve its purpose  What a great way to be reborn  Needless to say the gift card was a perfect gift
__label__Positive	very cute way to display

__label__Negative	I purchased 2 of these cards and neither arrived in time for Xmas
Kinda made me look like Scrooge
Hopefully this wont happen again next time I want to use Amazon as a place to purchase gifts
__label__Neutral	The gift card was as any other but in the description it plainly stated that the e certificate could be used in the store When we got to the store I was told they did not accept them  Therefore I had to go online to order and wait for it to arrive

__label__Positive	Its a gift cardit arrived on time the recipient enjoyed it Thats pretty much all you can expect from a gift card Good job Gift Card
__label__Positive	Amazon has something for everyone so I thought this was a better idea than any individual store gift card  Took one star off because the facebook delivery was a little delayed I sent the gift card while we were opening gifts but it didnt show up for a few hours on her facebook page
__label__Positive	This is massive so convenience to send a gift for someone
__label__Positive	Gave one of these to one of my daughters for a surprise Valentine gift
Got a very nice phone call after she found it in her email
Will do it again
__label__Positive	Gift card w a free card  Nothing to complain about

__label__Positive	The gift card arrived on time and was appreciated
__label__Positive	It is so easy and convenient to send an Amazon gift card especially when our loved ones are living elsewhere
Just send it with a click of a button  Amazing

__label__Positive	great product
__label__Positive	Easy to order and use at the restaurant
__label__Positive	The perfect graduation gift
__label__Neutral	On the one hand its great that it says Happy Birthday since it was for my big brothers birthday But having purchased the card in the amount of 50 I expected the cards packaging to say 50 in the upper lefthand corner But yes as pictured it said 15500 How would my brother have known how much the card was for I used WiteOut and a gold marker to change 15500 to just 50 which looked a little bush league
__label__Positive	What a great way to buy a gift  The shipping is free and it is a very convenient choice  The selection on Amazon is incredible I could not imagine a better gift card
__label__Positive	The gift card was easy to use and I didnt have to use it all at one time thank you for making it so simple
__label__Positive	As an adult learning guitar for the first time the biggest hurdle you face is boredom  Everyone can handle a little frustration in learning thats to be expected  But if boredom strikes you are doomed  Marty has an amazing talent for identifying your personal motivations and passions and then he devises a lesson plan that works from that happy place  So you WANT to learn  You have FUN learning  And the music comes  Hes not about scales and London Bridge  You get to play real songs that you pick right away  He is incredibly talented at on the spot transposing so the music you want to play can be adapted to your skill level  Genius  Really  And did I mention he is fabulously personable and funny  Yep that too  5 stars for Marty hes the Man
__label__Positive	This is the second time Ive used Amazon gift cards and I have had very good service They arrived on time and I have no complaints One of the best ways to give a gift So convienent
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	My boy deeply appreciated it and used it for something he really wanted
__label__Negative	Recipient did not know that this was from me  Recipient rechecked contents no gift note found  Rechecked order gift note instructions were entered correctly
__label__Positive	Well this is a gift card bought it for 20 even though it was a 25 one so that was nice

Not real sure how to review a gift card  It was sturdy but not too sturdy  It bent when you needed it to but didnt break  It was rectangular which is nice because that is the convention and so it fit in the proper slots in my wallet andor my wifes purse  On the front it said what store it was for that is a pretty nice feature  It was not too heavy it was very easy to lift so that made handing it to the checkout person very easy

Other than having a lower price for the dollars you get to spend in the store I dont think I can suggest any improvements
__label__Positive	Was easy to use
__label__Positive	It
__label__Positive	A lot of my relatives buy all different kinds of products from Amazon so this is a very convenient way to buy them a gift for any occassion

on the Amazon link what better way to buy something you may have hesitated to buy before Using a gift card enables a person to get what they wanted I would recommend them to everyone

__label__Positive	Someones birthday coming up but dont want to spend any time getting them anything

Why not give them a gift card to one of the biggest most wide markets there is

What can go wrong
__label__Positive	Very simple intuitive way to customize a gift card and everyone can find something they want at Amazon  Thank you
__label__Positive	Gift recipients love this gift card given the range of products available from the merchants One cant go wrong with this
__label__Negative	Im way to tired to go back over all the issues I had in receiving a card that was activated
The end result was neither my husband or my daughter received their Christmas gift
I ended up with the gift card money in my amazon accountwhich could not be transferredthis took almost 2 weeks
__label__Positive	A sturdy durable card and envelope Winter design was lovely and appropriate for a gift for a nonreligious friend
__label__Negative	Horrific experience with this purchase emailedsent 2 100 gift cards to friend she tried clicking on the get gift card button and it would open a webpage with an error message We spent 24 hours on the phone with amazon GAP and the third party which services GAP gift cards each specifying it was not their problem but the other companys ie amazon blamed GAP GAP blamed third party third party blamed amazon
Finally cancelled both cards as no one would take responsibility for this error which was not my first choice considering my friend was AT THE GAP store relying on this gift card amount during her shopping trip
Utterly disgusted and frustrated
__label__Positive	Awesome  Love this toons
__label__Positive	Very convenient
__label__Positive	My family loves to read and this gift was very easy to give to them so that they could buy more books to read
__label__Positive	Super cute and came with the gift receipt
__label__Positive	Granddaughter was thrilled since she now picks out her own clothes Gift cards came on time
__label__Positive	AAA  100 good
__label__Positive	Awesome Thank you  
__label__Positive	Now I can buy even more things from amazon
__label__Positive	This was an excellent way to receive a gift  I was able to purchase what I wanted and the person sending it was delighted also  Thank you for the idea
__label__Positive	Ordered CLOSE to Christmas and still arrived in one day Cute card fast easiest gift ever
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	My kids loved this as they are both grown perfedt gift   I love doing business with Amazon they are very helpful
__label__Positive	My daughters wanted to buy daddy a book for his birthday but it was the last minute this was the perfect solution
__label__Positive	nice gift box
__label__Negative	Do not purchase this card  As other reviewers said it comes inactivated  That means no money loaded on the card  Amazon replaced it and still inactivated  A real mess trying to get this fixed
__label__Positive	I cant tell you how amused I was that I could make a color in gift card for someone  I found out that my boyfriends mother was getting a Kindle for a present and decided that a gift card was the perfect accompaniment

Im only afraid it ended up on the fridge
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	Daughter was very happy to get it  Shes a huge Starbucks fan
__label__Positive	Awesome on time and happy
__label__Positive	I was weary to order due to the mixed reviews on this product  Happy to report my gift card arrived quickly 3 days even tho I chose extended shipping for the bonus credit on my prime acct  The gift card was clean seemed to be the current design or model iTunes gift cards that sell at the store  The money loaded easily with no problems

This is a single card not 2x 50 or 4x 25
__label__Positive	Ive been using these for the children in my life  they get such a huge kick out of seeing photos of themselves on the cards well worth it
__label__Positive	Excellent product
__label__Positive	We were able to purchase this via my phone while on a flight I am a flight crew member and they were able to watch it together and send me a screen shot back  It was a funny kid perfect card and made me laugh out loud
__label__Positive	The little replica Amazon shipping box is too cute
__label__Positive	It put a smile on my friends face Cant hate that

Although I thinks its really bad that whether you order it here or through Sephoras web site you dont qualify for the free samples Really Its their gift card only good for their products and you dont get free samples to maybe entice someone to buy other products

Very poor marketing
__label__Positive	Christmas Gift
__label__Positive	Arrived on time Wrapped and placed under the tree She is a baby and Im sure Mom has plans for it

__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Cutest card ever Recipient loved it
__label__Positive	LOLnot much you can say about a gift cardit either pleases the recipient or it doesnt and mine loved it  Pretty card  Well presented  I would suggest that a sticker or label indicate it is the gift card though I almost mistook it for wrapiing materialsadvertisemetn and threw away
__label__Positive	Received as a Christmas present a gift card to my favorite store  whats not to like I love Amazon
__label__Positive	Gave this as a gift to a friend She used it to apply toward a Kindle that she wanted  Keep this in mind  Good idea to send via email no shipping charge
__label__Positive	It arrived on time and was just fine
__label__Positive	Gift cards are the perfect way to give a gift It lets the person receiving the gift card decide what they want and Amazon makes it so easy to get and give them My niece only wants gift cards from now one I think the gift cards has spoiled her just a little
__label__Positive	I got this as a last minute gift  I loved the oneday shipping it really saved by bacon since I waited until Dec 23 to order it  The card was a nice quality and the packaging protected it well  Best of all I was able to let the recipient decided what he wanted and since Amazon has just about everything I knew who would find something good
__label__Negative	The gift card had a 45 degree bend in it  it wasnt flat like a normal card It is useless It cannot be used The seller needs to have a better quality control for this item
__label__Positive	Nice design and came next day Very pleased with this purchase
__label__Positive	They loved it Arrived on time
__label__Positive	Loved the gift box  It was the perfect touch  Will definitely order again
__label__Positive	Was a great addition to a 75th Bday gift  Very colorful and full of fun easy to print and fold into a card
__label__Positive	Item was as described and arrived quickly  Would buy from seller again
__label__Positive	This is an original gift to give with Starbux multiple cards  The receiver can keep some in the car their wallet or give them to family members I like to give some to the mail lady for delivering all of those Amazon packages in the snow and ice
__label__Positive	This is a great gift idea
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	Good

__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Came on time and as expected
__label__Positive	Procrastinated getting my daughterinlaw a gift  She was getting a Kindle for Christmas and this was a great way to help her get content  It printed to look very nice and couldnt have been easier to buy
__label__Positive	Cute Santa tin for the gift card  I have always loved the gift card tins offered at Christmas
__label__Positive	gift cards are always appreciated
__label__Positive	Loved the card for my gift card for my greatgrandsons birthday
Always happy to do business with Amazon because its so easy
__label__Positive	Great as always
__label__Positive	Easy for christmas  I would suggest that Amazon prompt the recipient to use the cards
__label__Negative	Apparently Amazon does not anticipate that a grandparent might want to send gift cards to all seven grandchildren It cannot be done without the help of a live assistant Nor can one write separate messages to each recipient or edit their addresses
This should not be difficult Even the live helpers cannot figure it out
Just dumb marketing
__label__Positive	Ordered as a gift Everything was great
__label__Positive	excellent safely  thanks
__label__Positive	This was so easy to do and a great gift to give  I will most definitely do it again  So easy and very convenient

__label__Positive	OK HIZLI MUumlKEMMEL TAVSYE EDERM
__label__Positive	All good Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
__label__Positive	Cute package  Gift card is always welcome
__label__Negative	First of all I meant it to be a gift for someone else but somehow missed the option and it came to me
It is ugly a 4 sided card was flat on the screen displaying all 4 sides together I will not order another gift card in this manner

__label__Positive	When in doubt let them pick out what they want  The purchasing process was so easy  I ordered the gift certificate and had it delivered to the recipients email address  It was perfect for a last minute gift  There are lots of theme cards to choose from birthday graduation Christmas etc
__label__Positive	Its money they cant spend anywhere else

__label__Positive	What a gift card Not only was it loaded for the correct value but it is worth every penny
__label__Positive	As advertisedgreat gift
__label__Negative	1 star for Amazon 1 for Safeway Because I dont know whos idea it was to use an ecard Like so many others the cashiers at Safeway have no idea how to use it Doesnt work at all on the self checkout area You must use regular checkout Why no option of ecard or plastic Amazon
__label__Positive	I used the amazon birthday gift card to send ebooks for a daughter in Europe this spring Then again for another daughters Birthday in the Peace Corps in Africa this summer It was great they could download their gift books directly onto a Kindle I did not need to spend 6095 on shipping charges for books flat rate to Africa I know that she really appreciates the ability to pick out her own books even if she has to wait to find wifi The only disadvantage is that she can not share the books with other volunteers It was much better than the gift baskets available in Europe and I searched for the right thing Sometimes I think gift cards are a cop out but in the terms of world travelers they can not be beat I hope you make someone very happy by sending one to them Read ON
__label__Positive	I love to shop at Amazon so what better gift  You just cannot go wrong getting someone an amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Amazon has everything so it is like giving the gift of everything
__label__Positive	The Plaid Gift Box was perfect for Christmas I choose to wrap it but its perfect as is too The gift card fit in snug and theres a small clear plastic rectangular window behind the gift card that was perfect to hold a scrap of paper with the gift card amount written on I found the writingonpaper method more elegant than writing on the plastic card with permanent marker and hoping it wouldnt smudge
__label__Negative	Its been nearly a month since it was suppose to come I highly suggest you do not buy this product unless you like to get completely screwed over
__label__Positive	Wife loves this place gift card worked great Wish it came with a little gift envelope though for nicer presentation
__label__Negative	U have to be crazy or feel the need to throw away good hard earned money to buy a iTunes gift card from a vendor on here as someone who prides themselves on making good resonable purchases dont do this Apple allows you to buy the gift card at no charge you can email them their card without the worry of it be lost or stolen or  if you want it to be in a cart Apple will allow you to pick out a card mailed him a card at no charge

__label__Positive	Came on time and the card was cute
__label__Positive	Bought this gift card because it was 39 for a 50 gift card and I love me some half price apps  There boneless wings are far superior to BWW and a whole lot cheaper half price app time and youre a fool if you think otherwise
__label__Positive	I will buy these again
__label__Positive	Nice gift
__label__Neutral	Did not print the entire code  I know that the problem was on my end but what a hassle Found it out from the birthday boy
__label__Positive	I tried paying other ways at Cracker Barrel such as provocatively dancing in the dining area wearing just a thong threatening the staff and running out as soon as I finished eating to go home and get cash or my credit card but each of those just got me arrested  The gift card however works perfectly

__label__Positive	Excellent gifts
__label__Positive	It looked beautiful as an ornament and the gift card was great to complete my presents for my boyfriend
__label__Positive	Fast
__label__Positive	I was not sure how to send a gift card to start with My son suggested it to send via email Everything worked perfectly and smoothly I emailed my friend who I sent the gift card to  to find out if he received the gift card via email from Amazon He received it within 30 minutes or so I was happy that he received it and he knew it was from me Thank you Amazon
__label__Positive	Nice quality  I have a feeling this is going to be a tin that passes around the family a lot 
__label__Positive	Did exactly what it says it would do but took about 45 hours which I didnt expect
__label__Positive	This is so easy to send and they are able to pick and choose whatever they want from your selection you have on line
__label__Positive	IT was great Sleek packaging and free next day delivery when I ordered Very satisfied
__label__Positive	Shoot I forgot to by a gift for the gift exchange Phew Amazon has me covered Safe

__label__Positive	I love that I can send the eGift Cards  I used this to recognize a coworker for helping me with an account while I was out of the office as a way to say thank you
__label__Positive	Awesome fast and convenient
__label__Positive	
__label__Positive	Unlikely the gift card has been used baby just born yesterday but I liked being able to print the card and incorporate the gift card into a physical card rather than give a plastic card    and because I procrastinate I was able to print the gift card and not pay for overnight shipping to have it in time
__label__Positive	What can I say about it  Its a gift card  It is exactly what you would expect
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	My stepson loved it
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with a gift card  My mother in law has a kindle and loves to shop at Amazoncom  She got a gift card from each of her children for her birthday and bought herself an iPod Touch
__label__Positive	Arrived in timely fashion and was what I wanted
__label__Positive	It was packaged so nicely I was very impressed
__label__Positive	Arrived when promised
__label__Positive	Ive had quite a few of these cards Mostly as presents but I recently bought a few off of another site that was having a 15 off of 75 purchase special

The process only takes about a minute I usually set up my tee time through the course website like I normally would Then fill out the form on the Go Play Golf website with all the info from my tee time The day before I play I get an email saying that a gift certificate has been bought at the course in my name and then the info of the person at the course When I check in at the course I tell them my name and they should have a GC for me They get it and thats it Never had a problem in the 25 times I have used them

I wouldnt buy this for myself without the discount since it wouldnt make much sense but as a gift for somebody else it is perfect because then they can play whichever course they want If you have a balance on the card that doesnt cover the cost of a round at the course you just fill out the request like normal and they will buy a GC in the amount you have left No carryover or lost money There are no fees associated with using it either It would be nice if they could be reloaded instead of always having to buy new ones but thats a pretty small thing
__label__Positive	Very easy to buy and easy to redeem
__label__Positive	Easy and fast way to send a gift card instantaneously No stamp required
__label__Positive	It comes fast and is worth 100 What else can you say about a gift card
__label__Positive	Love them thanksdelivery was a tad slow though
__label__Positive	Love it
__label__Positive	A
__label__Positive	These gift cards are so easy to purchase  give So many of my children grandchildren nieces nephews etc have facebook now and I am very happy that Amazon has made it easy to give them gifts I dont need to keep up with exactly what their address is anymore I keep up with them on Facebook
__label__Negative	My gift was to an older person who did not have a Facebook account Trying to withdraw it or gift it without that proved to e very difficult Actually I havent managed to get it canceled yet
__label__Positive	The egift card was sent immediately unlike the card from a different company which took 2 days to be sent
__label__Positive	I love this restaurant and I know the the people receiving this gift card will love it too because they love steakhouses  One could never go wrong with treating the ones you love with something they will like This is a good restaurant  Ive had good experiences there and the food is delish
__label__Positive	Perfect for christmas
__label__Positive	The egift card worked great I got it within 5 minutes  Before I headed out to my local Red Robin I called in to double check the balance was there and that my egift card code was valid and it was When using the egift card as payment it was quick and easy It also helps that the location I went to has really great staff
__label__Positive	Gift cards what can I say besides we love them and they shipped fast

Unfortunately it froze while I was reading the information about it
I had to pay for online help but all is well now
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love gift cards It came right on time 
__label__Positive	Sent this to my brosef when he graduated college He received it and had no idea who it was from just make sure at checkout you clearly annotate who the giver is Whats the point of giving someone a gift card as a graduation present if they dont know who its from
__label__Positive	Our entire family are members of Amazon  Great deals and prices  This was a special request from our soninlaw  Thanks
__label__Neutral	Ive ordered this before I love the cupcake tin and it makes a cute holder for an Amazon birthday gift card but this time it has three dents in it The first one was fine Should be in a small box not a mailer envelope
__label__Positive	Cute cupcake tin Product arrived next day
__label__Positive	Instant delivery Worked well on website
__label__Positive	card was funny and loved by all
__label__Positive	Gave this gift card to my son  Since I live in Canada and he lives in Chicago it was the perfect solution to a Christmas gift  He does love Amazon
__label__Negative	I gave this 2 stars because I had issues with the customer service which very much surprised me Usually Amazon has outstanding customer service The issue with this was that the recipients never received them I was concerned and called them to give them my email address and that way I can try forwarding over to theirs or I would at least have the gift card number to gift Simple enough Well I had ordered 2 gift cards and one of them were sent to my email address I was told that the other one was sent as well but I had never received it I called back on hold for 10 minutes explained the issue and how I needed the SECOND gift card emailed to my email address and somehow the rep mistook that as me telling her to apply the balance to my account It was a big mess and completely unnecessary Especially since the request was not difficult to begin with I was very disappointed
__label__Positive	A Nice metal Christmas box with gift card  Would order again Makes cute way to give gift cards I will get them again next year
__label__Positive	Great deal especially when I use coupons Love their subs
__label__Positive	fast and easy way to send a gift

__label__Positive	Perfect Christmas present for my Sister 
__label__Positive	Very easy to pick out was a gift for my mother with her new Kinda Fire she is not much of a computer person and she was able to redeem the gift card with no problem Great product
__label__Negative	NO gift card was inside and Amazon basically said   TOO Bad  After numerous phone calls and a lot of yelling they finally credited my account for the gift I DID NOT RECIEVE  Either a careless mistake on their part or a dis  honest employee either way it should not become my problem It is not like a credit card where they can stop payment or cancel
__label__Positive	The perfect gift for anyone on your list Super easy too
__label__Positive	The ecard came quickly and was perfect for emailing a tangible appreciation to an important client
__label__Positive	I love how easy it is to have these cards sent via Email to my kids and grandchildren

__label__Positive	Great pair with the tin and the card
__label__Positive	I really like the consideration Amazon puts forth for gift wrapping purchases by providing all the materials without gluing anything and leaving the final touches up to the gift giver Thanks for providing me with a great Amazon gift card and wrapping materials now I can write a note and seal everything up specifically for the person that I am giving the gift to
__label__Positive	gift card received by email and spent same day by birthday person
__label__Positive	It is better than paying for my purchases each time I buy the gift card when the exchange rate is favorable to me
__label__Positive	Easy
__label__Positive	great gift card
__label__Negative	I have given these as gifts  This particular one I gave my sister and she told me  Other times I never know if they got it or not  Can you find a way to let me know when someone has gotten a gift card I have sent them so I know it hasnt been wasted
__label__Positive	simple and instant

__label__Positive	makes a very nice present
__label__Positive	My Dad Loved It 
__label__Positive	I like how it is a well made full size Christmas card Plenty of room to write a sentiment The gift card is securely attached inside so no worries of it moving about or falling out
__label__Negative	I like this box  graphic but I needed them in amounts smaller than 50  Dont want to print from home  prefer to give an actual gift card in a box as gifts
__label__Positive	Great gift idea My girls loved it
__label__Positive	Person who received it liked it
__label__Positive	Great for someone you dont know what to give
__label__Positive	kids loved it

__label__Positive	I could purchase just what I wanted and could get great books for my kindle which has proved to be a bit addicting
__label__Positive	They arrived SuperFast and are very nice to give out
I would recommend this to anyone that have several people to give gifts to
thanks
__label__Positive	The person I gave this too said it was really easy to use and I felt good because they way they could choose something they really wanted for themselves
__label__Negative	iTunes cards are great They can be used for games music etc However if you go in almost any GameStop Walgreens CVS or other store you will find them And you will not pay 30 for a 25 gift card you will pay 25 Dont buy this get it from apple or a store
__label__Positive	Vety convennient to use and always a hit recipient appreciates the vast array of items available from Amazon instead of getting a fruitcake or something that they try to figure how quickly they can regift or put in the back of the closet
__label__Negative	The gift card that I was alerted about thru email was not my purchasenor was it sent from me to the recipient Could not find a way to notify Amazon that this gift card was in my account so Im sending this in the review Hope the right person receives it

Thank you
carly
__label__Positive	Good Deal 
__label__Neutral	I loved the idea of uploading a picture to a gift card  Ive done this before in the past iemovie gift card etc  An Amazon gift card was perfect  for a 1st Birthday gift  Mom  Dad can pick out a game book toy whatever for the birthday girl

What I was disappoint in was that an actual plastic gift card was not available  I could email or print out the gift card but I would have really preferred the plastic gift card  Something of substance to hand the family and possibly a keepsake because of the picture on it
__label__Negative	I bought these gift cards for participants in my dissertation study Not all of these were activated 23 of them were not activated I will never buy these from amazon again Im a student and cannot afford to buy more for my participants which put me in an embarrassinglegal issue when it comes to IRB and compensation that was promised to participants DO NOT BUY THESE ONLINE
__label__Positive	Excellent card was hilarious
__label__Positive	Easy to do Seamless email service
__label__Positive	Cute purse design but theres glitter on it Luckily the gift cardholder comes wrapped in plastic so the glitter doesnt get everywhere
__label__Positive	Super cute gift container Decided sometimes its nicer than an email gift card
__label__Positive	Purchased so that my son could do an in game purchase on his Windows Phone If a product is simple and just works how can it not be 5 stars
__label__Positive	These animated gift cards are great The recipient was hysterical over it and thought it was one of the best presents he received Will be ordering another at the end of the month These are just the best
__label__Positive	Seamless fast delivery cant ask for anything more
__label__Positive	Great gift  Ships fast easy gift to give at holidaysevents
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Since mom got her kindle this is the perfect gift  Easy to give and easy for her to receive and use when she wants and on what she wants
__label__Positive	Always the perfect gift
__label__Positive	All was good
__label__Positive	Thanks it was great having this option All i had was my cell phone and starving My wallet was at home And it was great and convenient to have the option available for me Thank again Amazon
__label__Positive	Came just as described
__label__Positive	What can I say Its Bass pro Shop Brother in law loved it for Christmas but I think it was my sister that took it 
__label__Positive	This was the cutest birthday gift card ever It was in a really sturdy heavy mailing cardenvelope and much nicer than just giving someone an Amazon giftcard that comes attached to a hanger from the store Shipped overnight from Amazon I will definitely buy more of these for gifts
__label__Positive	Purchased as a birthday gift for my mother law Airline gift cards are always a hit and great gift idea
__label__Positive	Its an email gift card It was delivered and claimed by the users so I dont have a lot to say
__label__Positive	Very desirable gift
__label__Positive	I purchased this on Prime Day and was able to get a 10 promotional gift card because of the awesome deals My favorite part is the really cool box the gift card comes in it looks like an amazon shipping box but its miniature so it would be fun to give as a gift
__label__Negative	10 Promo Code not working  Spent last 45 minutes on the phone with customer service  Still no gift card  UGGGH
__label__Positive	This was ordered as a Bingo gift  Everyone was excited and hoped to win it

__label__Positive	is what it is
__label__Positive	Giftcards are always the right choice for buying at Amazoncom
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Arrived on time Product is worth every dollar
__label__Positive	Good to be able to buy on internet but I could only get 2500 I wanted a 5000 card Need to have more options available
__label__Positive	Very nice
__label__Positive	The gift cards were gifts for my grand daughters birthday and they loved them
__label__Neutral	I purchased this gift card as a part of Amazon promotion  For a 50 gift card one can receive a 5 credit on their Amazon account  While I love the gift card design choices options to send it with a nice ecard and personalized message I have yet to see 5 credited to my account  What I really do not like is that there is no email toll free number or any other way one can inquire about what I consider incomplete Amazon order  What happened to Customer Service Amazon  There is only  FAQ page on your web site that DOES NOT have an answer to my question  when will I see my 5 credit posted on my account  I know that the gift card has been viewed and accepted by the intended party already  which is great but what happened to promotion
__label__Positive	It is what it is a 50 dollar gift card
__label__Positive	Totally easy and useful for a last minute gift
__label__Positive	great item
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Carthemed card is perfect for the gearhead in your family
__label__Positive	great
__label__Negative	Horrible food at Mount Prospect IL restaurant uncooked rice mixed with cooked rice place opens and doesnt have food ready  store closes early because they claim not enough customers yet while there on outside of place 3 other customers pulled up only to find place was closed 2 hours early  They clearly are placing money ahead of customer experience here  wasted my time TWICE driving there only to find it was closed when it should not have been  I will never buy a Panda Express Gift Card again
__label__Positive	Always a great gift option
__label__Positive	Made my nephew very happy 0n his birthday H3 loved it
__label__Positive	Great food with great gift card Convenient purchase on Amazon
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Negative	Cash  Card
__label__Positive	Adorable packaging for a gift card
__label__Positive	Recipient was delighted to receive the eGift card Giving an eGift card made long distant gifting easy
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Negative	I have no Idea if they received this gift card
__label__Positive	My granddaughter loves Claires and it was so easy to get the gift card on Amazon
__label__Positive	Christmas gift for my husband  he has great fun with it
__label__Positive	Happy with the purchase
__label__Positive	Was happy enough with the process but I wanted to give the Gift Card to a friend to purchase a particular ebook and could not do this as well as I had hoped Also the price quoted for the ebook turned out to be less than the final cost so she had to bear some of the expense
__label__Positive	MY NEPHEW IS GETTING A KINDLE FOR XMAS  THIS WILL ALLOW HIM TO GET MORE BOOKS AND ETC THANK YOU
__label__Positive	Bought this for a baby shower gift and the box is adorable There was no place to write amount or tofrom names though
__label__Positive	love convenience
__label__Positive	Appreciated by giftee
__label__Positive	Great product fast delivery easy to redeem Happy customer gift recipient was very pleased to get it a few minutes after I announced it was on its way
__label__Positive	Discounted Cold Stone  whats not to like
__label__Positive	I got this as a gift for my friend who buys everything through amazon Therefore she already knew she was getting a gift card But when I gave her the present she was very delighted because she wasnt expecting such a cute box with the card I think she was more happy to have her own mini amazon box than receiving the actual gift card
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	Excellent gift idealoved it
__label__Positive	Christmas Gifts
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	For the most part it was easy  One email address wouldnt process the email from Amazon  not sent to spam  The only option was to send the card to another email address and hope the intended party received the gift  I would have liked the option to cancel and then print the card for snail mail  At a crazy busy time for me I ended up dealing with a problem that I couldnt get answered and a gift that wasnt being received  Eventually I was able to send the card to another email address and the card was received  Other recipients received the card easily and enjoyed the hassle free gift
__label__Positive	Wonderful present loved them being able to buy what they want Thank you for a terrific shopping and gifting experience
__label__Positive	given as a gift
__label__Positive	Big hit for Christmas gifts

__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and just as expected
__label__Positive	This a really great and unique way to present someone with a gift card An iconic Amazon box shrunk down to the size of a gift card Guaranteed to bring a smile to your recipients face 
__label__Positive	Came faster then I thought great gift
__label__Positive	loved the way the card pops up when the front flap is opened
__label__Positive	Easy to buy Make recipients happy

__label__Positive	I was lucky and got this gift card at a discount off the face value  We like eating at Red Robin anyway so the discount is just a bonus  Their burgers are to die for and the bottomless fries are just a bonus  Burgers are big enough to share and there are lots of choices for the trimmings  Wish we could find more gift cards like this

__label__Negative	The mail at home gift cards usually come the next business day  I have gotten them in the past and the always arrive next day  The card was packaged in another envelope inside of a larger bupple wrap padded pre package Despite the packaging the birthday card holder came damaged  It came bent and unusable which is why Im disappointed  I am now making my own homemade gift card holder which I was not planning on doing
__label__Positive	It worked
__label__Negative	I was not able to choose the currency on the card  I did not want US
__label__Positive	Quick and easy

__label__Positive	I bought this for my stepfather because I was unsure of what he wanted He used it and was ecstatic with what he got as well as finding other things he didnt know he could find on amazon Total win
__label__Neutral	Had to go back and resend my gift via email since facebook wants to access all your contact information Shouldnt have to do that to redeem a gift given to someone
__label__Positive	Perfect international gift
__label__Negative	Didnt work for the recipient Amazon refunded the order
__label__Negative	i had just connected Hulu to my Spotify account and had to disconnect it to use this gift card Looking at the TOS I realize it says this is only for Spotify premium but how many people read the TOS on a gift card Dont show 60 as that implies its a 60 credit to your account as opposed to 6 months of regular Spotify
__label__Positive	I just bought this amazon gift card for one of my good friends for Christmas  She loves to shop at Amazon and I know she will love this  Was super easy to order and came very fast
__label__Positive	Am I really supposed to write a review for how well a gift card worked

__label__Neutral	I cant connect this kindle to my wifi It keeps asking for a password I have reset As per yr emails and it keeps advising that password is invalid I give up

__label__Positive	Loved it Was quick and easy and I didnt need to buy a greeting card  I would definitely order again
__label__Neutral	easy to use just wish i didnt have to do them one at a time  I sent out over 50 and they all had to be done individually
__label__Negative	Will only let you use on a higher priced same room option check out It actually shows you that you are being charged a higher price for using the gift card which works out to cost more than if you were to just use your credit card
__label__Positive	Its absolutely amazing My child can read play games learn and much more So easy to use for those who are not tech savvy
__label__Positive	worked great
__label__Positive	Was easy to use no problems

No problem or issues with this card
Works perfectly in my PlayStation
Love it
I will buy it again
__label__Positive	I bought this with sweaty palms 450 bucks for a metal card and a commitment to Starbucks for the next 3 years I calculated my average frequency of spending
But what about the card balance and its vulnerability to inflation
what if I lose it it is stolen i drop and scratch it
what if my friends or family find out about this silly purchase
does this make me part of the 1

So many questions so much speculation And now bliss I got one and Theresa didnt and now she is grouchy I love this card Ive used it 4 times on 3 occasions I have been 2nd glanced and then regreeted like I am Howard Schultz himself
The cute baristas have said Our manager said we will never see one of these and can I take a picture of it

I feel kind of like Brad Pitt using this card It has finally brought happiness to my life 5000 people have the chance to own one on this entire planet 8 billion people and I am one of the few The Proud THE STARBUCKS ELITE

__label__Positive	Its Bonefish Grill they have Bang Bang Shrimp plus delivered online
__label__Negative	Cant find anything in Austin TX that is close to me  If Amazon wants to sell this gift card we should also be able to use it towards Amazon purchases Otherwise its another gift card that will sit in my wallet for 3 years until I forget about it or toss it bc looking at it is so annoying
__label__Positive	It was very easy to proceed through the process for mesomeone who is not very computer savvy Great jobI will definitely shop again

__label__Positive	I am an author who writes only electronic books At the launch of my last book Drowning in Secrets I was able to purchase gift cards to give away as prizes with my book cover on the front They were beautiful and fun
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are always a good idea
__label__Positive	My daughter was delighted with this gift I am sure she will be reading books that I recomend that I have already read
__label__Positive	It arrived on time and cute boxed
__label__Positive	Was excellent once the Subways around me finally got a card reader to accept these Made them last much longer than anticipated
__label__Positive	Super great gift for the person you dont know what to get I asked her what her favorite Store was and she said Amazon
__label__Positive	Was a Surprised gift

__label__Positive	Purchased as a gift
__label__Negative	Why was I charged 10028 for a 50 gift card
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	So easy to buy and I love the packaging
__label__Positive	I purchased a 40 gift card from Amazoncom  It is easy and simple  It was a fast and smooth transaction  Would highly recommend
__label__Positive	I loved sending an Amazon eGift card It was very easy to sign up for it and send immediately And of course the recipient of the gift card was thrilled to receive it because she buys everything on Amazon Prime Its much better to send an eGift card than guess what someone wants and send an item they dont want and have to return
__label__Positive	Funn
__label__Positive	excellent provider
__label__Positive	What could be better or easier  Good selection of artwork giftcards available too  Its really a nobrainer and very convenient

__label__Positive	Easy to access and do not have to forget to send and they have a nice assortment of cards Prices are low or high depending on what you want to spend and the best part is you do not have to go out in the rain or snow to buy and then send it I liked this feature and the cards as well
__label__Positive	Nor much to judge on a gift card
__label__Positive	Adding my own photo was easy I printed it on photo paper for a more polished look
__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift Card I like being able to draft and print the gift as there is no waiting for it to be mailed to you
You have a wide variety of card selections to choose from with and you can personalize the card
__label__Positive	I love Amazon I can find soooo many things in Amazon I would like to request Amazon to sometimes compare the prices around 
__label__Positive	Just right for the occasion

__label__Positive	It was a gift to my Brother and Sister In law They love this restaurant
__label__Neutral	This never made it to the recipient and when I obtained a resend via email it did not work with the new number  My recipient had to call Amazon to get the card activated
__label__Neutral	Its good if u like Kmart works fine
__label__Negative	Dont send these to someones work email The email filters will likely not allow them If is a hassle to get fixed
__label__Negative	It was a day late and as it was for a holiday that was annoying
__label__Positive	It  was delivered
__label__Positive	great

Fletcher builds tension by moving the reader from one attempt on Rosalees life to the next as well as intriguing us with the growing connection between her two protagonists The story includes characters introduced in earlier books in the Northstar series increasing my interest in reading the others The author has a flare for writing unique metaphors that grabbed my attention such as his own love life was much the same Catch and release The naturally flowing dialogue makes it a fast easy straightthroughtotheend read You can have an entertaining time with this book
__label__Positive	Great Idea Very convenient  Im able to adjust the amount depending on if it is a Halloween Treat A Birthday Bonus or a Wedding Present  I have Legal  Official Blanks readily available to load and dont need to be stockpiled in different increment before they are needed and possibly lost

I hope this idea spreads to other companies

__label__Positive	everyone I gave these to had a blast with them  Some people have reused them and passed along the fun
My only complaint is that theres a ridge in the maze and its very difficult to get past a certain spot  I guess it makes it more challenging but for the person putting the card in it makes it difficult to do so quickly
__label__Positive	yes I used this gift card at a kmart that is closeing

__label__Positive	We needed gift certificates as awards for academic and character excellence  This was an easy way to purchase them all at once from home  My only difficulty was in printing them  There was no way to indicate which certificates had been printed and which ones had not without actually opening each one and comparing the number  The serial number should show without having to open each one which was very time consuming

__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards allows the person receiving the gift card to purchase the exact item they wish The purchase will always be the exact size and color that pleases the purchaser
__label__Positive	great way to get gift card
__label__Negative	Silliest policy for an e gift card that ive ever seen Once the gift card is sent to you the instructions require that you print it The point of an egift card is immediate delivery and ability to use Not everyone has a printer anymore so failure to disclose that one is needed made my gift card a huge waste of money
__label__Positive	Sent to nephew who was having surgery  Felt he was better prepared to pick a book or what ever he wanted to occupy him during recuperation
__label__Positive	thanks Amazon for making gift cards easy to deliver
__label__Positive	Amazon gift carrds are a great gift form my family Kids are older and they all purchase from Amazon when they cant find the product locally

__label__Positive	This egift card is super cute
__label__Positive	Once again a great gift for anyone
__label__Positive	great to be a gift
__label__Positive	This is my Grandsons favorite Birthday gift
__label__Positive	What to buy your niece special neighbor who watched your dog for two weeks daughters teacher  Let them decide when you send them an email Amazon gift card  You can buy various denominations and the gift is ALWAYS welcome  Amazon sells everything and their shipping is great so your gift receiver can pick exactly what they really want  Honestly I would prefer this gift over most things I have received over the years  You can still send a card through snail mail but you dont have to risk sending cash or a gift card through the mail  Love it
__label__Positive	I expected the email to arrive earlier in the day that when it originally arrived  But no worries he had it by the end of the day  Thanks

__label__Positive	This made a great gift for my mom to go along with the Kindle Fire that she received for Christmas  She ws able to buys some books and a cover for her Kindle
__label__Positive	very handy
__label__Positive	It cannot be denied  Amazon gift cards are the way to go  If your teen spends hours online and they to make purchases this is the way to go  My teen does not need MY credit card to make a purchase
__label__Positive	I love Amazon for so many things  I needed a lastminute gift for a friend and purchasing this fit the bill beautifully  I just printed it up and stuck it in a greeting card as well as forwarded the email I received immediately to my friend  Perfection    Thanks Amazon

__label__Negative	I ordered a 50 gift card for my husbandand boy am I thankful it was for my husband and not someone else The 50 balance was put onto a card labeled 350 When my husband opened it he was happy but had a look of you spent HOW much on his face When I looked at the card myself I had to apologize and say unfortunately it wasnt for that amount How embarrassing Good thing I didnt just purchase and ship one to a friend without being able to explain the true value They would have assumed they had 350

Im only giving two stars because they offer free oneday shipping Just wish the service itself could be trusted
__label__Positive	Work out well Very convenient for me
__label__Positive	great item
__label__Positive	Very nice Got it as a last minute gift Cute picture and card is of good quality
__label__Positive	Love this place
__label__Positive	My
 son loved it
__label__Neutral	These are okay you get 45 for Fandango which I bought as a Deal of the Day so it was a little less expensive but as far as ease of use they are not good

Theres no way to preload these gift cards to your account so we had to make sure the gift cards were always with us We usually buy our tickets on Fandango through our phone while sitting at dinner or on the way to the theater but if we had left the cards at hometoo bad

Theres no way to scan the cards with your phone either That means having to type in each card number 19 digits then scratching to reveal the pin number to type in another 4 Its a pain when purchasing multiple tickets that cost more than a single 15 dollar card so youre there typing scratching typing typing scratching typing from several cards like a weirdo
__label__Positive	love our Kindles
__label__Positive	The gift card got here earlier then what I was told that was awesome
__label__Positive	Easy and immediate gift giving I was very satisfied
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always a welcome gift for people  This was so convenient because I did not have to get in my car and go to the stores looking for a specific card  The person I sent the card to loves to shop Amazon so it was the perfect gift

__label__Neutral	it said free one day delivery I got it three days later I bought it on the 23rd so I could get it on the 24th and instead I got it on the 26th which isnt really great when youre giving it as a christmas gift
__label__Positive	Whats not to love about a gift card Came super quick too

__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Wow  This was amazing  Exceeded all of my expectations  I gift card thats worth exactly what you paid for it  Amazing
__label__Positive	I wasnt sure how this gift box would look but it looks great
__label__Neutral	I loved the idea of a gift card and knew we have sent them to different ones serving in different countries and so
thought this an ideal way to send a belated 80th birthday to a friend in England  It turned out to be a real headache for here
finally decided to use it on kindle  But UK Amazon would not accept the one Id sent by email or had sent rather
__label__Positive	Easy to use

__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Best gift ever
__label__Positive	My husband gave me the Amazon Gift Card for Christmas  I will use it mostly to purchase books on my Kindle  It is a very handy item to have
__label__Negative	As far as Amazon delivering and providing a quality product I find no fault I have experienced a terrible incident with our local Steak n Shake The corporate office was as helpful as they could be but it is up to the local store to make it right Out of the 2500 I used under 500 and cannot get the local Steak n Shake to refund me for the food which had a foreign object in it I filed a complaint with them and then BBB of Arkansas I am stuck with a 2500 loss Steak n Shake lost much more than that

__label__Positive	For some reason the gift was sent to my friend anonymously and he wasnt sure who sent it to him Otherwise it was a good gift
__label__Positive	You cant beat the practicality and expedience of these gift cards They may not show originality in gift giving but youll never have to worry about your recipient having to stand in long lines to return an unwanted present
__label__Negative	Feels a little weird that the card cost more than its contents
Taxes are a little weirdly added here when they dont apply at places like Walmart or target for the same thing
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are nothing new and they are very handy to give as gifts due to the diverse nature of products Amazon offers  certainly your recipient can find something he  she will like to order This gift card comes in a sturdy small box which adds a better touch to me than the standard email or printedoff versions at home as it shows you went a little further I also appreciate the fact Amazon delivers it for free with next day shipping

__label__Positive	Met my expectations
__label__Negative	Not happy at all with amazon The very thing amazon has asked me to review was for several unauthorised transaction which after making many phone calls trying to get reimbursed they just seem to be very good at passing me round to another wrong department with no result So amazon Maybe Im the wrong one to ask for a review
__label__Positive	This is so adorable The top is magnetic so its easy to open and reusable
__label__Positive	Amazon really knows how to make gifting work for both the giver and the receiver You dont even need to go to the store to get the card
__label__Positive	I want my baby back baby back baby back ribsssssss Chilis Baby Back Ribs singing Arent you  glad you cant hear me
__label__Positive	It was greathowever at first it you did not recognize or accept my aol account so I tried to sign up with my gmail account thinking that was the email address you had online for me  That didnt get accepted either  Then I received a phone call from Amazon but I didnt take it   I did however call Amazon and spoke with a very nice representative  After that call I was then accepted on both email addresses and had to pay for 2 of the same card  Good for my son but not good for my wallet
__label__Positive	Cute little way to give an Amazon gift card These made great Christmas presents
__label__Positive	Nice and easy
__label__Positive	worked like a charm
__label__Positive	I purchased a gift card for a birthday  I was unable to login in to the server to print it  I could login to my account but could not get to the print area that way  I ended up getting a refund and sending a gift card by email  This was disappointing as it took three days to resolve
__label__Positive	Ordered 10 of these all arrived with the proper amount loaded on to them
The fact that they only come in 25 increments is annoying but all the cards worked perfectly to it doesnt matter 
__label__Positive	Not bad Nothing much to say I was able to purchase my 55 TV through a website that gave me a discount if I purchased it using an Amazon Gift Card Thanks
__label__Negative	This gift is for my greatgrandson who is 13 years old  He has not received it as yet but I hope he will enjoy picking out his own gift
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	This was an easy cheerful gift that can be ready instantly for giving Friends were delighted with the gift and the printed card

__label__Positive	What do you give someone who has everything An Amazon gift card Unexpected and very appreciated
__label__Positive	Great Gift Idea
__label__Positive	This is a plain card in a sweet little gift box I highly recommend Takes the basic gift card up a notch
__label__Positive	Easy gift for those far away
__label__Negative	Do NOT buy  I purchased this December 2016  However throughout the year I went to my local TGIF restaurant and they either said their equipment is broken and could not accept eGiftcard or they dont accept at all  So I thought it was just a computer error  Ate and paid with my money  Recently some coworkers reminded me that I should use the gift cards I have because businesses could go out  So I called the restaurant again to make sure they could accept  The receptionist said they cant honor it  So I was telling her that was a scam  She got me a manager and he asked me for the card number  I gave it to him and after a while he said it has a zero balance

TGIF sounds like a scam
__label__Positive	Always a good buy for someone you have no idea what to get them
__label__Positive	Yep perfect gift
__label__Positive	Really cute and plush bear with obviously an awesome 100 card attached The hat is especially fun to play with for the bear

Only thing I could say is that the stitching around the eyes looks a little off gives the bear a matted look but just a minor flaw
__label__Positive	As Expected
__label__Positive	Great for the 20 somethings
__label__Positive	This product arrived quickly and I havent had any trouble at all with it Im very happy with this order and will likely order again
__label__Positive	Great as a across the miles gift
__label__Negative	The card did not work  Gave it to my mom for her birthday and the waiter said it would not approve  Maybe they sent me an inactive card  What to do now
__label__Positive	This is a great way to send US dollars gifts Its also a greetings card with your own personal messages added  When its difficult to choose a gift its better to let tem choose their own perfect  thank you
__label__Positive	Excellent purchase
__label__Positive	We use Amazoncom gift cards as a Thanks You for customer referrals  There is no fee you can get most anything you want and there is no expiration  Our customers love them
__label__Positive	I like being able to add a person message to the card
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Easy shopping
__label__Positive	As expected
__label__Positive	Thanks Amazon

__label__Positive	Adorable
__label__Negative	Fandango is the worse  They take your money not guaranteeing that you will have or seat or even if the movie you wanted to see will be playing  They are just out to get your money and the customer service is terrible  Wait on the phone for 45 minutes to speak with someone only to  have them tell you nothing can be done unless its within the hour of your movie time  Like if you would actually call from a movie theater and not the next day  Atroicious
__label__Positive	Cute for dog lovers

__label__Positive	A great gift idea for the person who has everything Easy to do
__label__Positive	I loved the animation my grandson loved the gift card  
__label__Positive	This was quick and very easy and allows the recipient to buy what they need or want It was welcomed well too
__label__Negative	This is complete and total SCAM by amazon my shopping cart showed that it was qualified for promotion and amazoncom emit lying and ripping off customers by not reading pages of fine print not even an offer to reconcile your companys mistakes You would be safer to getting visa gift card from your bank save your money
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Great I was sick and couldnt make it to the store for a staff gift exchange Made it easy to participate Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are nothing new and they are very handy to give as gifts due to the diverse nature of products Amazon offers  certainly your recipient can find something he  she will like to order These gift boxes however are a little more classy than the standard email or printedoff versions at home as it shows you went a little further the box is very sturdy and I appreciate the fact Amazon delivers it for free with next day shipping If youre going to be spending 50 or more for a gift card which is the minimum price to have it delivered in a gift box like this I would recommend you gift this version to your recipients
__label__Positive	as expected

__label__Positive	The best gift when you cant think of a gift or ran out of time to shop
__label__Positive	I gave this as a Christmas gift and it was well received Now my daughter in law can order what she really wants and get the best price on Kindle books
__label__Positive	Grandchildren love them
__label__Positive	Cat on front was perfect she loved it Easy to order delivered when promised
__label__Positive	I like having Amazon Gift cards on hand  This makes it easy to catalog in my Holiday book the gifts and notes that I send out during the year

I was not too happy that they just came in the mail without any security which means had they been Lost in the mail where would I be  I may have missed where I could pay for a more secure shipping
__label__Positive	It was accepted enthusiastically  My daughter appreciated it
__label__Positive	Always a pleasure to get an amazon gift card Endless array of things to choose from Cant go wrong giving these as gifts
__label__Positive	Good value for what I paid They were given away as a prize and the family who won them went straight to IHOP for pancakes for dinner
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	A different look 
__label__Positive	It was delivered quickly with no issues
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with Starbucks GCds used two as party gifts and kept two for myself
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Negative	Two gift cards were not activatedI will never buy amazon gift cards again I am surprised at Amazon for not doing something about this I had no response to complaint
__label__Positive	Very good buy excellent seller
__label__Positive	Very flexible and easy gift
__label__Positive	Soooo easy to buy gift and use I love shopping with  Amazon This takes all the worry out of giftgiving
__label__Positive	Worked great for what it was for
__label__Positive	Showed up quick No problems at all Im a bit late in giving this review as I ordered two of these for xmas gifts but they showed up right away and my son has gobbled up the bucks
__label__Positive	The best way to shop something in the right moment
__label__Positive	a great gift
__label__Negative	It said there was no such email address
__label__Positive	It was an Anniversary gift for friends Liked the design and they redeemed it instantly     
__label__Positive	I was thrilled when it arrived the next day  Nice presentation  Saved me the cost of purchasing a card or a gift card holder
__label__Positive	Convenient Gift Cardsno waiting at the store
__label__Positive	Thanks our nieces was surprised and loved doing it
__label__Neutral	Card was tattered
__label__Positive	Love amc it doesnt expire and its sold at face value I couldnt ask for more
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly
__label__Positive	daughter wanted it to by her school books
__label__Neutral	Great to give Amazon Gift Cards to people at a distance that youre not sure about what they would like  At Amazon they can find anything  Perfect  The only problem with this deal was we were led to believe that we would get a 25 bonus gift card for each 100 we spent  We ordered a 200 gift card expecting two 25 gift cards  None came  After inquiries they eventually gave us one 25 card  Kind of frustrating  Recipient loved the 200 gift card though  I recommend it
__label__Positive	Voucher is easy to order and have delivered and is especially good for long distance gifts even more so if it slipped your mind and is a last minute gift

Main thing to be careful of is to make the voucher you get is suitable for Amazon Site the recipient is going to use ie buy a couk voucher for a UK resident and get a com voucher for a USA resident etc I almost made that slip up
__label__Positive	Great Job
__label__Positive	Was a great deal Im glad I went online that day so I didnt miss it
__label__Positive	Love to get others gift cards to Amazoncom  Really enjoy all of the choicesstyles available  The recipients enjoy spending them also
__label__Negative	I printed the gift card and sent it to a family member  When he went to use it there was no code on it  It was a lot of back and forth between him myself and the company to get it so he could use the money on the card  Although the company was very helpful with it all it was such a hassle I will rethink using this again
__label__Negative	I also just uncovered the letters and numbers from a card my daughter gave me for Christmas 2016 only to be told it was used  It has sat in a drawer all this time and was never even opened  Cannot find a phone number to contact them to see who used this  Would love to be able to hear a human voice to see about  Will never never purchase a card  Total rip off
__label__Positive	Such an easy way to give a gift card especially at the last minute Ill remember to do this again
__label__Positive	Loved the box It was really cute
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Negative	I felt with a lot of problems getting this gift card Just buy from the Panera site
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	Fast and very convenient
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and made a great gift
__label__Negative	gift card lol what do I say great product my only issue is it used this for a purchase i didnt approve so gift kinda got wasted
__label__Positive	My grandchildren loved getting this little Amazon box with the gift card to get what they want  Great idea
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Sent within the allotted time 5 minutes Was able to use the code and pin immediately A good gift card to use for online movie ticket purchases from Fandango
__label__Positive	great for a quick gift order and print on your home computer fold add your own message and wala youre set
__label__Positive	Prompt shipping no issues
__label__Positive	It was for our granddaughter Our Son and his wife gave her a Kindle and the gift card will be used to buy some books  games
__label__Positive	Yes very much
__label__Positive	The Amazon Gift Card is awesome  I purchased it to enable Kindle books to be purchased but really it can be used for heaps of stuff
__label__Positive	Great way to personalize a gift card
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Positive	These were a gift I heard no complaints
__label__Positive	Easy
__label__Positive	Parents loved it
__label__Positive	Card receipient loved it
__label__Positive	My grandsons thought it was really cool  That doesnt happen too often
__label__Positive	Cute  Nothing easier or better than an amazon giftcard
__label__Negative	 clueless
__label__Positive	My first card was damaged somehow on its way here so I was sent another I saw after I got it all the reviews saying they were given cards with 0 so of course I called and made sure my 25 was loaded onto this card it was The only issue I have is that its not a niceregular plastic gift card Its more like cardboardkinda cheap looking I could rip it in half But I suppose itll do the job
__label__Positive	Amazingly speedy delivery
__label__Positive	Great deal during the holidays when you can get it for 40 and can be upload to your Samsung Pay device so no more lugging around a gift card
__label__Positive	This is a very convenient and easy gift to give  always loved and appreciated by the recipients
__label__Positive	What is not to like
__label__Positive	Quick easy last minute gift that is sure to please I mean who doesnt shop on Amazon This way they can get whatever they wantneed and can use it to buy something that costs much more than I would ever give them jk
__label__Positive	daughter loved this of course
__label__Positive	This is a solid metal box that is a really nice way to present someone with a gift card It looks good and could probably be used by the recipient to hold all kinds of other things If you shop at Amazon a lot you can even do what I did with this wrap it put it into a small amazon box and wrap that then put it into a medium Amazon box and wrap that then put it into a large Amazon box and wrap that Using lots of those air packs that Amazon ships with everything to keep all the smaller boxes from shifting around and giving away the game
This helps you get rid of some extra Amazon boxes you have floating around and has the added benefit of making a wrapping paper mess at your favorite cousins house If you give it to your favorite cousin of course
Just make sure that if you do this you have the person you give it too open it at someplace other than your house or you will be stuck with the boxes and the wrapping paper mess
__label__Positive	Always a nice gift The box is very  cute
__label__Positive	The gift cards with free overnight delivery are super
And you cant lose as a gift
My granddaughter said oh Amazon books books books
But another granddaughter likes other things so its a winwin  They get whatever they want
__label__Positive	Buying a gift card through Amazoncom was very easy  The person that I purchased this for is very difficult  Now with the help of the gift card made it simple for me and easy for her to buy whatever she wants especially since she shops from Amazoncom
__label__Positive	This is a great way to give a birthday gift to someone in a hurry I use it all the time with good results The only issue I have is that there is no notification emailed to the sender when delivery has been made The buyer will have to log on and track it from the Amazon link I would have given 5 stars if it were not for the one issue
__label__Positive	This way to purchase the gift card was hassle free and instant Nothing could be easier I will always use this system to buy all my gift cards
__label__Positive	My mom loved the gift card
__label__Positive	This card is amazingI was able to put 100 dollars in it I hear you can put more too It lightweight and very easy to carry around in my wallet Its transferable since I have it to a friend She said it was a wonderful gift
__label__Positive	CHEAP
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with this  Bought as a gift
__label__Positive	Easy gift idea
__label__Negative	took way too long to get
__label__Negative	I chose the cupcake design for my gift cards and came a different one not even included in my options It was blue and the gift was for a girl Also the envelopes were smaller than the cards and in order to be able to deliver gift as it was a Bday present i had to cut the BDay card It was to late so i couldnt go and bought another one
too much trouble for a gift card
__label__Positive	Setup was easy and the print options were good as well no complaints
__label__Positive	So easy and wonderful to send to troop in Europe
__label__Positive	It was a gift
__label__Positive	This was a great Christmas gift for someone who is hard to find gifts for
__label__Positive	It was convient and easy and my Dad loves to have a credit for his kindle

No issues with this
__label__Positive	Very good and fast shipping
__label__Positive	Terrific
__label__Positive	excellent
__label__Positive	I ordered a number of gift cards from Amazon as Christmas presents  all arrived within a brief time frame in excellent condition etc  And the recipients were all happy to get the cards
__label__Positive	this was a gift card for some one
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	I have had good experiences with Amazon gift cards The recipients like them because they can be used for a wide variety of purchases  The cards can be delivered several wayssnaillmail email or to me for hand deliveryand make great lastminute gifts when I have almost forgotten that a birthday was coming up There is no activation fee handling fee or other nuisance
__label__Negative	Took over a day to reach me
__label__Negative	Booked two tickets via Fandango which lets you return tickets but they cannot because of the gift card And then the AMC theatre cannot even print out the physical tickets cause its not in the system
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Wonderful
__label__Positive	Great way to send gifts to my out of state family At first I felt I was being lazy but all the family love them Who doesnt love cashgiftcards
__label__Positive	Arrived in perfect condition in a nice little snowflake tin just like the picture Kept me from having to wrap anything so Im of course thoroughly satisfied

__label__Positive	Awesome gift

__label__Positive	People love gift cards and this was no exception
__label__Positive	Its a Gift Card what is there to say
__label__Positive	A great gift for grandchildren who live far away
__label__Negative	My father accidently deleted his gift card email before writing down a number he needed to order something  Neither he nor I could find any way to contact Amazon about it to get the problem resolved  Its as if Amazon doesnt want us to ever use them again for gift cards  My Dad never got to use it
__label__Positive	Excellent way to reward people or gift people you dont know what to buy for overall great gift
__label__Positive	Love it Its an adorable amazon package that contains an Amazon gift card that you can use to receive even larger Amazon packages Theres a marketing genius at Amazon and that person is doing things right
__label__Positive	Love this idea and my dad loved it when I gave it to him Very cool
__label__Positive	I never know what to get my husband for a gift so I usually just give him an Amazon gift card He loves it he can get just what he wants I got him the just married design for our 18th anniversary and sent the message Well we were just married werent we even though it was 18 years ago
__label__Positive	Everyone loves getting am Amazon Gift Card
__label__Positive	An excellent choice for anyone hard to buy for  I especially liked the box for the gift card  It saved me having to wrap it and was perfect just as it is
__label__Positive	Being able to print off a gift card for however much money you want to spend in just a few minutes is a great userfriendly quick present to give someone
__label__Positive	Perfect gift quick easy delivered as promised  Came in a nice box
__label__Positive	Its a bit odd to give a gift card a review so this should be rather short and sweet  Shipping was fast due to my Prime membership and the recipient loved the gift  I like the idea of an actual card rather than the kind one prints Thats about it
__label__Positive	Just the right gift  Delivered on time
__label__Positive	Cute gift card I like the way it was setup
It will make a nice gift
__label__Positive	I got a gift card and a Kindle for the holidays and it was the PERFECT gift The combination meant weeks of enjoyment and the set up was a breaze

__label__Neutral	I sent one gift card with a photo and the recipient LOVED it  The next time I tried to do this on a Christmas card I couldnt upload the folder or get the correct amount for the gift cards  I tried about five time and finally decided to send checks instead  Id really prefer the photo gift cards though
__label__Positive	I liked this product because my robot master told me to
__label__Positive	Simple and easy gift My friend loves books and I can get one to her easily by using an Amazon gift card

__label__Positive	Always a great gift card to have on hand THE BEST
__label__Negative	So disappointed the card came in a plain white box not as it is the photo
__label__Negative	My box was damaged It was missing the bow and the tag saying Peace on Earth and only a glue mark They put a shrink wrap around this defect item Needless to say its a hassle to package it back to return it and rush order another one in time before the holidays But what upsets me more is that the system is also not allowing me to return because its a gift card I would like someone to contact me to resolve this issue Thanks
__label__Positive	Easy and personal Younger daughters asked how I did it I laughed
__label__Positive	Always the perfect gift
__label__Positive	Great gift for anyone who is an Amazon prime member
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an amazon gift card The tiny amazon box that it comes in is super cute and has magnets in the flaps to hold it shut Very cute idea

__label__Positive	It was so easy to purchase the voucher and it arrived within 5 mins to my daughters account in the US Will use service again
__label__Positive	Its Amazony its gifty Just what I suspected
__label__Negative	I purchase the gift card as a baby shower gift for my coworker  Since people dont pitch in till the last minute I had to wait to make the purchase right before the baby shower event at the office but I could not print the gift card  I received a message saying there has been some technical issue and should be resolved

I had to be creative and draw the card since it needed to be presented to my coworker and his wife in front of the entire office staff

I would think twice about purchasing a giftcard from Amazon

__label__Positive	My wife absolutely loves Amazon so this was a nobrainer for a Christmas gift  She can use it throughout the year for anything she needs from Amazon which can be just about anything

__label__Positive	This a great way to give the gift of pampering or an opportunity to attend yoga classes  Be sure to check participating providers in your area before buying  There was only one day spa in my city of 100000  Also note that the the card is single use  If you dont use the entire amount available the provider may issue you one of its own gift cards or some other sort of store credit
__label__Positive	Great gift card
__label__Negative	hi im writting you because i review so many times in my box currier for this giftcard and they tellme that never come i want to know what happend with this because i pay for my product

__label__Positive	Always a great gift when time gets away from you
__label__Positive	Loved it Very funny
__label__Positive	Paid 50 for a 60 value gift card Use it to buy the items that I need to buy any ways The only down side is that I had to wait for one month for the 10 bonus and I had to use it within the month receiving the bonus
__label__Positive	given as a gift to a family member who loves PF Changs 
Easy to purchase and send
__label__Negative	Did not deliver as promised Still awake up with neck pain
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Negative	Safeway should not be offering these if they dont let the people who work in their stores know what they are

Its such a great and convenient idea but as other reviewers have noted some many store employees are clueless about what they are and are leery of allowing such an electronic gift card to be used  If you leave the card on your phone they are suspicious and if you print it they are suspicious  Its a no win  Dont buy one  I need to ask Amazon for my money back
__label__Positive	My daughterinlaw loved her birthday gift

Thank you so much
__label__Positive	Perfect for me with grandchildren in another state

__label__Neutral	We love Amazon but in ordering eGift Cards weve not had the best of luck I purchased one for my Brother for Christmasit took TWO weeks for him to get it electronically He had also sent one to me It took THREE days to receive it and couldnt get it to work on my order I had to call Customer Service to get help on BOTH of them Great Customer Service though
__label__Negative	Ordered 37500 in gift cards with separate tins for each so I could keep track  350 x 4 tinsI was sent 4 of the same folded cheap quality cardboard envelope things instead  1400 bucks total rip off  Yes I saw your weak disclaimer that substitutions might be madebut this was awful

__label__Negative	I ordered a gift card for my sons birthday  I love Amazon and have never had a problem with them until I ordered this gift  Well it did not arrive on time and I called and they issued me a second card which came on the same day the other one came  I gave my son one and being a good citizen called Amazon to tell them that I received both cards  They told me after about 5 calls that I could keep both cards as a gift and I was so thrilled  That feeling was soon taken away as my sons card was cancelled  I then called again and they told me they would give me a credit on itstill waiting  I gave my son my card and he was able to order  It was just a big mess talking to many people and each one was doing something else with this gift  Order from Amazon any time but forget the gift card  I am

__label__Positive	In need of a present for a birthday the following day I decided to get an Amazon gift card  First I was going to print it up but then decided to email it since Amazon has animated cards just like the Hallmark website including Hoops  Yoyo two of my most favorite little card guys  Only at Amazon the card is free and the recipient gets to buy whatever they want at Amazon    in the price range of the gift of course    which can be in any amount from 50 cents to 2000 The amount I gave was closer to fifty cents than 2000 The ecard was delivered early in the day too
__label__Positive	Such a great gift idea  Pay for it print it and give it as a gift  Gift giving made super easy  I will do this again and again  Thanks
__label__Positive	Amazing

__label__Positive	I love the ease of sending a greeting with a gift card I ususally send a Blue Mountain Card with an Amazon gift card but I have used your greetings also
__label__Negative	Received the package with dents to the item Not happy
__label__Positive	It was refreshing to see gift cards available for same sex couples 2 tuxes 2 wedding gowns  Im sure the fact has not been lost on Amazon that same sex couples often have more disposable income than often younger heterosexual couples who are planning for a family etc  Therefore it makes good business sense to recognize that same sex marriage is a fact in over half of the country and to cater to that specific market just as heterosexual marriages children grandchildren graduates birthdays holidays etc are catered to
__label__Positive	Excellent as per usual  Neil Shee
__label__Positive	Gift Card for a family member Thank you for the prompt shipment
__label__Positive	A truly generic gift that can be regifted Recipients can really use this

__label__Positive	Quick Delivery A
__label__Positive	my usual anniversary gift very handy and everyone likes the gift card
__label__Positive	I liked this card because I could get it in a denomination that was not available over the counter in the store  It was delivered immediately to the recipient and I was notified when the card was used which was right away

__label__Positive	Great gift for the BBQ party
__label__Positive	Amazon What can you say about a gift card for any amount

Why should anyone rate a gift card

It is in my opinion that all gift cards no matter the amount should be appreciated So why do you ask us to rate them
__label__Positive	Love to have Amazon Best gift
__label__Positive	The gift card can be used to purchase what they want and at their convenience  It is  alwas the best size shape color
__label__Positive	Fine but a little confusion buying it
__label__Positive	One size fits all gift
__label__Positive	I printed out the card easily and tucked in a purchased birthday card  so much better than the usual email which often gets delayed dumped in the spam folder or not accessed for days Really cute too I plan on doing this again
__label__Positive	All aspects of the order and delivery were perfect
__label__Neutral	I wouldnt recommend this as a gift It shows up looking ratty the card is barely attached to the cardboard If you to present this as a gift I HIGHLY recommend just buying your gift card FROM Sephoras stores it comes with a cute compact mirror for free I purchased this because I got an Amazon gift card but I wanted make up so basically I used it on myself It works no doubt about that The presentation is just off
__label__Positive	WOW THESE CARDS ARE LIKE REAL MONEY ONLY MORE EXPENSIVE
__label__Negative	I brought these gift cards for gifts and was informed today that one of the cards could not be used The clerk said the card hadnt been purchased and I paid for it Im not happy about this Going to contact the others embarrassing and also my back to have my money refunded because payment was received
__label__Positive	None
__label__Positive	GreatGrands love shopping at Amazon so were very pleased with Gift Card
__label__Positive	great idea as a present for someone who has a kindle was impressed with the fact I was able to buy a gift card and give to friend of mine as a birthday present
__label__Positive	Came on time and was exactlyas described
__label__Positive	granddaughters favorite store
__label__Negative	I requested a note to my granddaughter accompany the gift card
There was none

Do I have to say more
__label__Positive	My husband is and I was an avid fly fisherman and one thing you learn quickly is that you always need things from the specialty stores He was thrilled to receive this gift card prior to a trip to some new water And it was so easy for me to buy for him
__label__Positive	The card was adorable better than just the plain gift card you can get in the store
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	What a more personable way to send a Thank You Easy fast and could not be more convenient I will use this form again
__label__Positive	Always a winning gift
__label__Positive	As decribed
__label__Positive	Good gift
__label__Negative	The cafix ad pictured in its label hot and iced cafix  with a brown lid  What I got was cafix with a green lid which only makes only hot cafix  The brown lid cafix makes both hot and cold cafix which I had before and used for iced cafix  Now I have to heat  the water  and put  in a container that has a teaspoon of cafix
__label__Positive	Gift for nephew
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for anyone
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	eGift Cards are great
__label__Positive	Works
__label__Positive	so convenient and answered all my needs
__label__Negative	Eventually the gift card got to its recipient through email 26 days late Id suggest following up with the gift cards recipient with his gift card code so it can be used immediately
__label__Positive	Its a gift card and it worked 
__label__Positive	Cant beat a gift card 
__label__Positive	This is such a wonderful feature  Im discovering this is the only way to give a gift for your loved ones
__label__Positive	Quick painless no hassles
__label__Positive	Linda
__label__Positive	always a great gift
__label__Positive	Great gift I purchased 2 within the last month for my sons This way they can pick exactly what they would like at their leisure

__label__Negative	Never received promotion deal the only reason I purchased the card
__label__Positive	Quick delivery of the egift card and flexible customization Editing the photo was very easy No problem printing the certificate
__label__Positive	Its a gift card what more can you say
__label__Positive	Amazons gift card purchase system is quick and easy to use  We use it to reward our employees for going above and beyond their job expectations  I recommend Amazons gift card program to our employees because they can accumulate them like a savings account and buy just about anything from Amazon
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly 
__label__Positive	You can create your own design send across the world and all free of charge  Cant complain at all all
__label__Positive	Item arrived on time and as described
__label__Negative	Not worth it Buy gift cards for a better friendlier website
__label__Positive	Love saltgrass Email drlivery was late
__label__Negative	Terrible experience  Received two cards only to find out someone already used them  Very frustrating and extremely shady
__label__Positive	Christmas gift for my Godchildren loved it
__label__Positive	We used this for a graduation party  It looked so stylish on the table and worked wonderfully  It added a touch of elegance
__label__Positive	Very covenant  and a good way to give a gift card instantly I will use this  again I would recommend tkis to others
__label__Positive	Whats not to love Its a 50 GiftCard that I purchased for 40 and got points on my Amazon Prime VISA great way to stock up on GiftCards to give as gifts
__label__Positive	Liked the three pack
__label__Positive	they loved it
__label__Negative	love it
__label__Positive	I bought this for my nephew for Christmas because I knew he would really like the cute shipping box the gift card came in He loved both the box and the 25 gift card inside
__label__Positive	Very helpful First card stolen at door Sent second card immediately No charge
__label__Positive	Nice birthday gift for a friend
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	I USE Regularly for certain people  Very handy
__label__Positive	The gift card was fine when it actually worked  I tried to check out using the gift card and it wouldnt scan at the register  The code showed as an error  Then someone came over and we did it through the credit card machine  Didnt work  She scanned the card and then the code on the back of the cardboard  Didnt work The manager said that another gift card didnt work earlier in the morning  I was taken off the line to the customer service area where I showed my Amazon order that I did make the purchase and it should be validated  We dont know why but it worked at the customer service register  I cannot say if it is the scanner bar code or register that was giving the issue but it finally worked  I am hesitant to purchase another gift card in this way from Whole Foods
__label__Positive	The only thing I can say about this is that it took like 5 days to just ship  Didnt think a gift card was that much work
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly  Very happy
__label__Positive	Best pizza
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Neutral	I found this product brilliant but I would add the possibility to have a sort of receipt when the Gift Cart is being opened
__label__Positive	It was the perfect gift for a book lover who orders from Amazon all the time Thanks so much
__label__Positive	Grest
__label__Positive	Box made it the perfect Christmas gift
__label__Positive	It was an emailed gift card  Fast easy purchase Delivered right away
__label__Positive	They are gift cards What else can I say It is nice to buy them online instead of wait in line and have amounts added to each card My husband uses these as client gifts so we order a lot of them I like the convenience
__label__Positive	Really good present idea
__label__Positive	It is what it is  perfect gift
__label__Positive	Cant miss with this gift
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are great to give as a gift and they are even better to receive
__label__Negative	could not book hotel stay with
__label__Positive	Convenient  perfect
My friend lives in Great Britain so this was the easiest way to send her a gift She asked for a Kindle gift card on her Twitter lol so I sent it to her via email The ability to email it was an awesome option that she can redeem online You can also schedule for delivery so I sent it on Christmas at midnight her time Also youre able to set your own amount andor pick a set amount which as convenient I will definitely use it again
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Positive	Each year I purchase the gift cards for my sons and they enjoy using them for Amazon purchases

Merry Christmas
Tom Grace
__label__Positive	So easy to use and a great last minute gift idea
__label__Positive	Havent recd it yet
__label__Positive	This is a very attractive card
__label__Positive	I bought this for my mother who has everything she needs and wants what this gave her was the ability to buy whatever books she wanted for her Kindle  She told me it was the best gift because it allowed her to choose what she got  Ill remember this
__label__Positive	Cute card  Printed with no difficulty
__label__Positive	Came sooner then was told Person I got it for loved it
__label__Positive	Perfect  easy
__label__Negative	This is a scam These card skills are empty and not valid Do not buy
__label__Positive	I enjoyed personalizing my gift card to a close relative in this fun way
Easy to do free enjoyable
Try it
__label__Negative	Despite my carefully crafted gift message that fit the required length criteria the message was not printed in the greeting card
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Enjoying the gift card so far still have some more to use Im just glad amazon has everything This would be a great gift idea for practically anyone
__label__Positive	We got a gift card for a birthday  This is one of my wifes favorite places  She and our 8 year old order breakfast no matter what time we eat there  Usually at least one of them orders Mamas French Toast They do serve a reliably good breakfast but I dont know that it is any better than Waffle House  It is just a little more consistent  I like the Beans and Greens with cornbread or if really hungry roast beef  We have gotten in the habit of skipping the really good deserts and buying a box of Goo Goo Cluster Supremes and another of banana MoonPies  The Goo Goo cluster with pecans is my favorite American candy bar  Our daughter has developed a taste for them as well so on this visit my wife approved two boxes

Cracker Barrel is a good and dependable restaurant  We had no trouble with the gift card
__label__Positive	Nephew in America loved it A great gift for family abroad  He turned 4 and loved choosing his birthday gift 
__label__Positive	I bought a gift card for my daughters birthday because she always shops Amazon  It was a lot easier than I thought it would be  One great thing about it is if you have to mail it as I do the postage is just the normal postage for a card  If you are mailing a plastic gift card the PO charges another 100 to insure it doesnt corrupt the card in handling I will get these gift cards for Amazon for Christmas presents also
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	Its just great being able to order all the books  A wonderful gift for me as I recover from the experience of getting a new knee Very easy to access and use No glitches and the books appear like magic on my kindle
__label__Positive	pipi cucu
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with this gift card

__label__Positive	was on a friends wish list and he got it very quickly
__label__Positive	She was very happy to receive it
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for great niece
__label__Positive	Easy for overseas gifts  grandparents take note Now your grandchildren can choose their own presents with a little parental assistance of course
__label__Positive	This is the best bet for an adult child who knows exactly what they like want or need  Keeps me from guessing on items sizes colors etc and the recipient from having to show appreciation for something that they dont like
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	satisfied
__label__Positive	Needed a gift and needed it fast This was so simple I was able to purchase it print it and put it right inside the card
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Positive	Great as a gift
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	VERY GOOD IDEA FOR A GIFT
__label__Positive	Perfect since my check and expensive card was lost by postal service  Will only do Amazon gift cards from now on  I liked the belated birthday greeting but sure wish they would expand belated birthday greeting cards only a handful to choose from  It is delivered within 5 minutes  I dont know anyone that doesnt buy on Amazon  I will not waste the time of purchasing an expensive card writing a check postage and the hassle again
__label__Positive	She loved the automation card
__label__Positive	helpful  for gift giving
__label__Positive	It was the easiet thing to do and went along perfect with the gift of the Kindle from last year
__label__Positive	The ecard was a great gift for a teenaged boy who has just about everyting  The purchase was convenient quick and quite easily made
__label__Neutral	I assume that this gift was enjoyed by the one given it She used one before I heard no complaints as she loves to fish and this is something she can utilize for buying fishing supplies
__label__Negative	I didnt like it because i though I was buying sizzle and only got the steak
__label__Positive	There was a mixup when I ordered it and when I changed it to a gift it was still on my account when her sister went to activateuse it she put in her own email address which was a subemail address of her mothers  Due to her lack of using the sub email address it had been deactivated never heard of that before but after spending much time on the phone with customer service we finally got it straightened out hopefully  I cant say enough about your customer serviceit is stellar
__label__Positive	Yum
__label__Positive	as advertised
__label__Positive	A 25 gift card that you can send on the fly  whats not to like The recipient can choose whatever he or she wants but they have a warm fuzzy card to remind them of the giver
__label__Positive	An excellent way to send a gift to a friend or family member that lives a long distance from you
__label__Positive	Arrived via email in less than 5 minutes  I was able to use one that night
__label__Positive	Was just what I needed Thanks My Daughter loved it
__label__Positive	I know most people dont think about it  I didnt  Then I did  Now I do  Always will  I bought this and a few other things that I thought he would enjoy for my TRASH COLLECTOR  The guy works his arise off flawlessly and he takes whatever I put out to the curb no matter what and not ever gives it a second thought  I realized that without real thought he deserves a THANK YOU  So I got this for him as a thanks to let him know I REALLY APPRECIATE the JOB YOU DO
__label__Positive	the packaging it comes in aka the gold polka dots case is just even better in person this was perfect as a gift for my cousins wedding will be buying more
__label__Positive	Yes thank you  It was well received  Thank you too for offering a Nativity scene with your selection It made giving a Christmas gift overseas so easy money usually spent on postage is able to be put towards the gift which makes a more generous gift  Very happy about this
  Edie
__label__Positive	What can you say  Cash cards are the perfect gift giving  This is masculine and better than a card
__label__Positive	This is as good a universal gift as one could possible ever givereceive
__label__Positive	A great way to send a gift even if you dont have their home address handy I really liked the custom email templates that you can choose from

__label__Positive	My dad was really excited that he would be able to pick out his own gift and I was pleased by how quick and easy it was to print out I used a thicker card stock and bam Instant gift card This was the first time I got one and since then I have given another one to somebody else who also loved it I will be using these in the future for a convenient lastminute decision to give I never seem to think of those things until its nearly too late

__label__Positive	This card was very convenient when we didnt want to carry cash with us My husband used the leftover for lunches
__label__Negative	You have got to be kidding me  I am being asked to review a gift card I purchased  Come on amazon beef up your system to skip things like this  Annoying

__label__Positive	its ok
__label__Positive	Great product and fast shipment

__label__Positive	Whats not to like It was delivered timely and it was easy to order
__label__Positive	excelent gift idea
__label__Negative	Wanted to send by email couldnt find it like in the past  So guess I will have to call her on Mothers Day and give her the redemption code  Although by one of your feed backs its paper  trying to get it ruins the number  What to do
__label__Positive	gift for my sister she liked how it was wrapped
__label__Positive	cute bear

__label__Positive	The process of obtaining a gift card and having it sent on the right date was very good and easy I have used Amazon on several occasions and have been very satisfied each time This is a very good and easy way to provide a gift for any of the occasions you need to
__label__Positive	I use these for family that is far away as safe way of getting a gift to them They appreciate the ability to shop on Amazon as well
__label__Negative	The gift card arrived promptly with no hassle It was the one I picked out and the amount I selected However it gave me the option to add a message I came up with a sweet heartfelt message that I knew would guarantee a chuckle from the receiver I received my package and opened it ready to sign Unfortunately the message appeared to have gone missing When I ordered the gift card the order details included the message but between then and now the message disappeared from the card Needless to say I am very disappointed and am disliking having the receivers joy from the present be dampened from attempting to interpret my handwriting
__label__Positive	Always the perfect gift for those you cannot figure out what tot buy

__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift card Everyone loves Amazon
__label__Positive	I have never had a problem sending an ecard or having the receiver pick it up It is my Grandchildrens choice to purchase their own presents Never have to pay for cards that they dont care for They just want money or a gift which is available to them on Amazon

__label__Positive	This product was purchased as a gift for my wife who enjoys reading it was the perfect gift for her
__label__Positive	just right
__label__Negative	The tin was damaged upon arrival  Disappointed  The item could not be given as a gift
__label__Positive	If you are not sure what top get someone or just want to say thank you this is the easiest way to give someone a gift Whether they want some electronics or music they can get it through Amazon Plus its Eben easier to send this card through several medias including Facebook
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Negative	My granddaughter guessed the gift card she received for her birthday was from me because this was not the first time a gift from me has been delivered from Amazon to their home without any information about sender  I did fill out a gift card it was acknowledged in my order confirmation but simply left off the gift card mailed to her  Very disappointed
__label__Negative	I bought 3 Kindle Fire devices and they all 3 have the same issues The screens will lock up or completely shut down and will not come back on without having to hold down the power button for 30 seconds and then clicking it again This is a nuisance and I can foresee it becoming a worse problem later
__label__Negative	I think we got scammed this card came and it didnt work when we tried to load it into I tunes store Very sad for my son that spent his 25 Amazon Card on this
__label__Positive	Giving gift cards like this is so easy I love it This card in particular was so funny I laughed out loud The person I sent it to laughed as well
__label__Positive	Quick delivery Gift card as described
__label__Positive	Its always nice to give the gift of choice An Amazon gift card is perfect since the choice is plentiful and quick delivery
__label__Positive	I bought a 100 one and a 50 one but I dont know which one is which
__label__Positive	just the right gift and nice metal box to hold card
__label__Positive	its cute but made of paper not plastic
__label__Positive	Just give them what they want
__label__Positive	very very very fast
__label__Positive	Easy to use
__label__Neutral	As other reviewers have said the white box arrived dirty  Not so nice to give as a gift which is the whole point of a gift card box  Be prepared to wipe the box down before gifting it  On the plus side it did arrive the day after I ordered it
__label__Positive	yes
__label__Positive	I bought this for my niece for Christmas and she loves it She is able to buy whatever she wants from Amazon using the gift card instead of me just trying to find something she may or may not like
__label__Positive	no comment
__label__Positive	Cards work as described however IHOP sucks and I wont eat there again
__label__Positive	Beautiful card The size is about right Not too big or small Amazon makes it so convenient Definitely buy again
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	Was worried the gift card wasnt going to work and be a scam but it worked perfectly Arrived on time and the paper wasnt crumpled or ripped I used the gift card in store and gave me no problems
__label__Positive	My son was glad to have his choice of so many items for his kindle it was a perfect Birthday gift
__label__Positive	The one error that was made was to print Merry Christmas instead of Happy Birthday except that it may
have been my error instead of Amazons
__label__Positive	My wife is having fun in using it Haha
__label__Positive	Great cardgreeting
__label__Positive	Always like giving amazon gift cards Super easy and people always want them
__label__Positive	As some of my family live abroad  sending Amazon  gift  cards  are perfect  Thank you for making it so easy for where ever your family or friends live 
__label__Positive	A really great network with PLUSES
__label__Positive	It was helpful in assessing my husbands oxygen levels during his illness  Sometimes its accuracy varied but in general it was useful
__label__Positive	GAVE AS GIFT LOVE THEM
__label__Negative	If you are in America these cards are great  can be used to make any purchase personalised and handy If you are in Australia or lots of other parts of the world they are a frustrating trap You can still buy and use a gift card to order something to be sent through the mail but not to purchase ebooks which are the most popular items wanted by those I have gifted You see the credit goes to Amazoncom not Amazoncomau which apparently operates as a seperate entity The Conditions of Use in microscopic print list some Amazon sites as not being available for Gift Card use but not Australia even if you have managed to locate that section My address is in Australia my account is connected to an Australian bank account so it is obvious where I am from so why isnt there a clear warning that flashes up to check that I am aware that I cant use the card here Havng said all that the help desk got back to us quickly and after some fairly vigorous discussion did refund the cash
__label__Positive	love the packaging but wish there was a tiny card to insert to tell the recipient how much the card is for and who from
__label__Positive	My daughter loved this gift
__label__Positive	This is a very easy way to purchase gifts which can be used for any item the recipient wants or needs

This gift is perfect for any age person of either sex Great way to go

__label__Positive	If in doubt for what to give for a gift you cant go wrong with Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	The little purse shape was perfect for my needs
__label__Positive	our sons dog chewed up his card the only thing visible is the  100 dolor what can be done  it was one of three purchased
__label__Positive	Came quickly and packaged in a appealing way
__label__Positive	Great way to send a gift to overseas friends
__label__Positive	Its a giftcard so theres not much to say about it lol What I will say though is I absolutely loved the packaging The GC holder is as pretty in person as it was in the pictures Perfect stockinggiftbag stuffer
__label__Positive	This is the perfect gift for anyone  You can purchase it and print it off from your computer
You cant go wrong when you give this
__label__Positive	Just as described
__label__Positive	I am happy to be able to print a gift card immediately for those last minute people I may need it for at Christmas and other times
__label__Positive	Were used as Christmas gifts so grand kids could get what they really wanted
__label__Positive	Email gift card instantly delivered and recipient was able to go shopping that day
__label__Positive	I have never used Amazon before and found the whole process very satisfactory
Would definitely use it again
Many thanks
Eva
__label__Positive	I had no idea what to get my cousin for her birthdaythen I remembered she has a Kindle I decided to give her a Amazon gift card  chose the option to buy online and have the code sent to her via Facebook During the purchase I was connected to FB and then chose the recipient from my list of friends  A notification posted on her FB wall and she was able to redeem the gift card by clicking the link and verifying her her account identity The gift card amount posted directly to her Amazon account with no problems  It was very easy to purchase and redeem
__label__Positive	Best way to assure recipient will appreciate a gift  they choose their own
__label__Positive	Kids loved it

especially when it was sent to someone who had helped me in getting a job assignment fast
__label__Positive	Best pizza in the Kalamazoo area  Great staff fun location buy a gift certificate for yourself AND someone you care about  everybody wins
__label__Negative	Extremely disappointed in the poor quality of the products I received For example  hamburger patties shrank to the size of sliders  gourmet hot dogs had the taste and consistency of the 2 packs for a dollar variety found at your local store  fillets were merely okhave had equal quality from local stores Basically a waste of good moneygo to walmart or any other store in your area and see what you are getting before you buy
__label__Positive	Great lightning deal  Card arrived quickly and saves us money  What else can you say
__label__Positive	Cute container
__label__Positive	Normally I spend Christmas alone but not this year I have an army of warm fluffyTeddy Bears to keep me company

Best of all I have a bunch of Amazon gift cards to gift myself for those special ocassions Or when I need to equip my bear army with candy canes
__label__Positive	Arrived next day  Makes gift giving easy
__label__Negative	It took to long to arrive in my email
__label__Positive	I love u baljit pls dont leave
__label__Positive	Bought this as a gift for my husband who loves the restaurant
__label__Positive	What a great place for family enjoyment
__label__Neutral	I read reviews that Amazon has occasionally inadvertently sent your gift cards to the wrong person then refuse to honor their mistake and then ask you to contact your credit card company to correct their mistake This made me somewhat wary which in turn reduced the amount I was going to send So far so good keeping my fingers crossed
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	its a great way to get some who is picky a gift by making them pick themselves  Amazon need to keep innovating like yall are doing
__label__Positive	These are always great
__label__Positive	Everyone loves a nice gift card  Cant go wrong with a gift card

__label__Positive	Convenient and fast

__label__Positive	Gift card worked great
__label__Positive	A perfect gift because it can be used in the shop or for eating
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong
__label__Positive	AMAZON GIFT CARD  I didnt know what to get my niece for her graduation so her mom mentioned an Amazon gift card  Well I went online on a Thursday and ordered a gift card  Amazon site said it would be delivered by Friday the next day  Well I didnt have much hope for this as that seemed to be much too quick  But the fact is IT WAS DELIVERED THE VERY NEXT DAY   I was amazed and so thankful because I needed the card in time for my nieces graduation  THANKS AMAZON FOR SUCH QUICK DELIVERY SERVICE
__label__Positive	Happy with purchase
__label__Positive	We love Red Robin  The burgers and food are great and they have a kids menu that my kids really enjoy  And you really cant beat the bottomless fries

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card  When you are buying a gift card for yourself it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off  We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20 off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price  Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal
__label__Positive	Free with a purchase not much else to add
__label__Negative	I dont see the  5 bonus which was promised
__label__Positive	Work fine Awesome food
__label__Positive	
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	This is a great way to get everyone what they want and the idea of getting it via email was extremely easy and convenient
__label__Positive	excellent  thanks  excuse the delay was traveling  highly recommended 
__label__Positive	FINE
__label__Positive	Works
__label__Positive	Perfect for Teacher gifts and summer birthdays
__label__Positive	Everyone loves an Amazon Card
__label__Positive	Really easy and you get it fast If you need a gift card today thus is the way to go
__label__Negative	I didnt order them Someone hacked my amazon account
__label__Positive	Its great last minute gift with a little personalized affect  Marvelous idea and greatly appreciated by the person receiving it
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Nice gift box
__label__Positive	Just perfect
__label__Positive	A perfect option for me and my family to purchase several articles instead the currency exchange control in Venezuela since 2010
__label__Positive	I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter  She was very happy with it  It arrived in time
__label__Positive	Love using the Amazon gift card
This is the way to go so all those little charges dont hit my bank card
__label__Negative	My dad went to use it and someone used it illegally  Meaning stole what was on the gift card before he used it  Im never buying an online gift card again  Very disappointed with your policy
__label__Positive	Who does not like getting a gift card Especially at Christmas and especially from Amazon
I will buy them for other occasions
__label__Positive	I sent it to nephew fir his graduation It is a great way to give a gift to some one whom have everything and U do not know what to get them
__label__Positive	This was a great gift for mother she can purchase what she wants or needs from the many items amazon sells
__label__Positive	good deal
__label__Positive	Do you have anyone on your list who you have no idea what to buy for them  These gift cards are the way to go  You can get the actual card sent to you in less than a day or you can have them emailed to the recipient Since Amazon carries almost anything the recipient has a lot to choose from  Unfortunately 25 isnt enough to get free shipping anymore when the item is selected so hopefully the person will be willing to put their own 10 to it to get the item they choose shipped for free
__label__Positive	Two thumbs up
__label__Positive	Super cute case and fast shipping
__label__Positive	Gift Cards are always a great idea
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Easy to use and cute design Thank you
__label__Positive	I love sending ecards I get a confirmation letting me knowntje recipient recieved it Make shopping for a present fast and simple
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	A truly amazing purchase Did you know that if you buy this fake card for a nominal amount you can then exchange that value for books I HAD NO IDEA GIFT CARDS WORKED LIKE THAT So when I got an email from Amazon asking if this purchase met my expectations I had to come straight here to comment that it had actually exceeded them tenfold Will definitely be buying this again and recommend it to everyone
__label__Positive	Loved that I could just print it myself no searching endlessly to find one at a store  Was perfect for gifts  A Great idea
__label__Positive	How could you not love a gift card
__label__Positive	Sending actual gift cards in the mail to someone is a little risky but with the printable amazon gift card  if for some reason the mail gets lost or doesnt make it there  you can simply reprint it  My family loves Amazon
__label__Positive	Exceptional
__label__Positive	Child didnt seem to excited by the gift
__label__Positive	Awesome for the price deal
__label__Positive	Love cheesecake factory
__label__Positive	My friend was elated to receive an Amazon gift card Allthough I lost the 1rst one Amazon quickly replaced it I will definately buy more of these

__label__Positive	Got it in 2 days Awesome
__label__Positive	Sent to our daughter living across the US She received the card the day of her birthday and was able to buy what she wanted Thx

__label__Positive	Quick shipping and exact product

__label__Positive	Sending this gift card was easy and fast The person I gifted was able to make a purchase with it with no trouble at all If the need arises again I would not hesitate to buy another one
__label__Negative	Amazon wants to censor our product reviews  So I cant explain why you shouldnt buy this gift card  Just dont bother
__label__Positive	so easy to do  I would like more choices on the get well pictures for the card  The confirmation was almost immediate and the card came to my email box within 10 minutes

__label__Positive	Love the ease of sending  personalized gift card Thanks for this option
__label__Positive	Thececard was easy to get and convenient
__label__Positive	got this card 25 offhow can you say no to that
__label__Positive	After receiving the gift card from my company as a Christmas present I was thinking what I could possibly buy  Well once I went to your website Amazoncom I felt a bit overwhelmed with the merchandise to choose from  But I got started and really digging looking at all the pretty stuff it was hard to choose  I just love it  This is my first time buying clothes and shoes from a website online and they actually fit with no problem  Cant say that when I go in person

Thank you for my choices and I expect to buy more soon  Just keep sending me my reminders and your new arrivals  Just love it

Sincerely yours
Tinkerbell
__label__Negative	Code would not work
__label__Positive	Was perfect last minute gift ideathanks
__label__Positive	I love getting Amazon gift cards  I just enter the code in my account and then I order stuff at will  The best thing about this card is that you dont have to carry the card around  The balance is there in your account  No lost or forgotten gift cards
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Procrastinator that I am I waited till the last minute and had my back up against the wall sweating bullets What am I going to do Then it hit mea gift card What better way to for a woman to spend Christmas that shopping for herself

Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Instant gift giving
__label__Positive	It was exactly what I wanted
__label__Positive	I purchased a 65 dollar gift card and received this in 5 minutes I read the negative reviews but also noticed one person had put up a recent good review as a verified customer and purchase That was when I decided to take a chance and I got it within 5 minutes and then I checked out within the next 2 minutes This works and you should definitely but it if you are thinking of doing so
__label__Positive	Cards are good and showed up fast which helped us with our promotion
__label__Positive	Easy to purchase even on the day needed  It allows recipient to use it for whatever they want to buy
__label__Positive	He was happy to get the card  One size fits all
__label__Positive	works well please note that you must type the entire number into the box copy and pasting will not work with any of these cards as it seems that some of the numbers dont appear and you get an error codeotherwise its perfect works from abroad too
__label__Positive	Always a good choice
__label__Positive	Granddaughter excited to shop
__label__Positive	Bought for 40 during Prime sale How can you go wrong
__label__Positive	It worked very well A lot easier than picking something and guessing what the recipient might find useful or desirable
__label__Positive	I love giving gift cards because I feel like that allows the person to pick out something that they really like and want  A good gift indeed
__label__Positive	How can you complain about a 25 gift card purchased for 20 when you planned on shopping there already
__label__Positive	Its a great gift to give to someone  I didnt realize how many airbnbs there are all over the world
__label__Positive	I love sending these  I am in my 60s and dont always know what they want  However one thing
that has not changed through the years is they always love gift cards

I also seem to forget their birthdays until it seem to be the day of the birthday  I love that I can email a birthday card
and they get it right away  There is so much that they can purchase through Amazon that they LOVE it 

Thanks for having this available online  It sure saves me 
__label__Neutral	The image was upside down and I had to have them call me both times  They called twice before getting things right  Although it was what the person wanted I you have to ask for help with site it is to difficult normally  It was also hard finding a way for them to contact me  Both calls were prompt  but I had to wait on hold for awhile before someone picked up originally  If you arent  ready wait until you are to contact the person
__label__Positive	Much appreciated gift
__label__Positive	This option was easy to use The print option was ideal
__label__Positive	The photo was just what I was hoping for  a bunch of creatures looking forlorn because we were saying goodbye to a friend moving out of state It really made her laugh And putting it together was easy
__label__Positive	Worked as intended Thank you
__label__Positive	Nice look
__label__Positive	I needed a last minute gift and this was perfect  You are able to send it right to your email and print it right away and you can find anything on Amazon so everyone wins

__label__Positive	easy solution and great gift
__label__Positive	I absolutely love purchasing gift cards for all occasions from Amazon Everyone who receives one raves about what they can purchase  This particular gift card was for a childs birthday gift his parents are always buying something awesome for him from Amazon As expected they purchased a play yard gift for him from my gift card one that he wanted It is so hard to buy for some young children and this was the perfect gift Received a beautiful thank you with him and his play yard gift that they purchased

__label__Positive	More popcorn

__label__Positive	It was adorable  My soninlaw loved it
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	VERY FINE PRODUCT THE SAME THAT IN THE PICTURE I HOPE I WILL BUY IN ANOTHER TIME FROM VENEZUELATHANKS YOU
__label__Positive	Due to the high cost of postage from Australia to England it makes it very difficult to choose a gift to send by mail overseas Receiving an Amazon Gift Card means that the receiver can choose their own gift and something they would really like
__label__Positive	Exactly as expected
__label__Positive	happy with the card
__label__Positive	Easy to get  Was sent immediately and best of all I didnt have to worry about it getting lost of stolen in the mail  Unfortunately that happened to a friend of mine
__label__Positive	Gift cards for any occasion make a great gift Whether its Christmas or someones  birthday a gift card from Amazon makes the perfect gift

I like giving these for any family members as it gives them the perfect gift Especially when they have their eye on something they want or need I used gift cards to help buy a monitor last year Best of all when you get gift cards from Amazon all you have to do is add the amounts to a running balance and you get those items for free If you have enough in gift cards to cover the cost of the items

I remember getting a computer floor mat for free with the use of gift cards Love them and they are always welcome gift
__label__Positive	very satisfied
__label__Positive	Its a convenient and effective to gift

The covers are dodgy Need some creativity and better options
__label__Positive	The egift card was super easy to send and really brightened the day for a sick coworker A great option when allergies may be triggered by flowers and illness decreases appetite This gave them the option to download music movies books whatever they needed
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Buying gifts for tweens and teenagers is sometimes challenging Cute card options Great last minute gift and no postage necessary
__label__Positive	Great gift and extremely fast delivery
__label__Positive	My son loved this gift card He is always shopping on Amazon and this is a perfect gift for him thanks
__label__Negative	The puzzle came with the ball scrambled SO in order to place the gift card I had to do the puzzle myself It took too long and I lost interest in giving it to the grandkids
__label__Positive	Great quick gift
__label__Positive	thank you
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Negative	Dislike giftcard doesnt work anywhere
__label__Positive	Well I ordered this card specifically for how the box looked  It was secured in a plastic bagand whoever packaged it just shoved it in and the bow was messed up  I had to get my curling iron and fix it  Frankly that is ridiculous  Fixablebut come on  How hard is this for 100  The idea and the design great  Very nice  Execution less so
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Neutral	Bad packagibg

__label__Positive	A 50 gift card for 40 A great deal for a great store I found it confusing it was available as a gold box deal but who am I to question that
__label__Positive	I will make it a saving Beautiful card thank  you for the useful service Regards have a nice day Bye
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Positive	This was the perfect treat for my sister who lives out of state  She recently had had knee surgery and she was beginning to do a little walking which she needed to do  She has always loved ice cream so I thought this would get her out of the house  It didand she loved it
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	Bought this card as a gift for my granddaughter who frequents the movies often  She loved it
__label__Positive	Quick and relatively easy
__label__Positive	Gift cards at Amazon make perfect gifts because theres something for everyone at Amazon  I like that I can order the same day its sent to the recipient so I never miss a birthday  They then can go online and choose a gift they really want  I like receiving Amazon gift cards so I can order new books for my Kindle  its the perfect gift
__label__Positive	Always a great go to
__label__Positive	My daughter loved it  I ordered the egift card with my mobile phone through the App and my daughter received it just in few minutes  She also used all of it the next day 
__label__Positive	Pretty straight forward  No issues redeeming  Purchased for my girlfriend
__label__Positive	Teenagers always have something they want from Amazon so this was a ideal gift for our out of town granddaughter
__label__Positive	fast and convenient
__label__Negative	I ordered a single 50 gift card as a present for Christmas two gift cards arrived in the mail I gifted one of them Later I got a call from my friend stating the gift card was empty That was really embarrassing I cant gift someone two gift cards and say oh only one of them have 50 good luck Im pretty disappointed with Amazon gift cards Ill opt for a different gift card next time
__label__Positive	Just what I wanted Thankyou
__label__Positive	Perfect gift when you dont what else to give Who doesnt love shopping online
__label__Positive	My Mother used her gift card with no problems

__label__Positive	It was great just to print out the gift card What a time saver This makes shopping a very pleasant experience
__label__Positive	I love that I didnt have to leave my house to get this gift certificate Especially as this was a Christmas present and that time of year is busy It was nice to be able to order this through Amazon and not be outside with the crazy shoppers My girl loves Sephora so this was the perfect gift for her There was no hassle in getting this in the mail either
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Everyone likes a good gift card
__label__Positive	I know my son very well  Not only is Amazon his favorite place to shop an Amazon gift card is his favorite birthday present  Thank you Amazon for making my giftgiving so easy and making my sons birthday a happy day
__label__Positive	a fun gift card
__label__Positive	Super convenient
__label__Positive	All ways works when I buy them and I always receive them early
__label__Positive	great little gift card
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	Great Card it works perfect
__label__Positive	I was very impressed cards were easy to purchase I even uploaded my own pictures to them and the kids loved them in their Christmas stockings  What a great and easy gift idea purchased right from home
__label__Positive	Havent given this to the person yet I am sure he will love it
__label__Positive	and gift cards like you youll have to agree that this certainly is one of them  It can be used on a myriad of things you find on Amazon from crack to hookers as long as they are indeed available for purchase in the Amazon marketplace  You cannot use this card at a physical Kmart location for instance
__label__Neutral	Very expensive you have to pay 35
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are the greatest for giving to family out of state We usually do this for Christmas and birthdays Grandchildren always have an Amazon wish list so these really come in handy as gifts to them
__label__Positive	I never know what to get my dad for birthdays Fathers Day etc and these gift cards make it easy He can find literally anything he wants on Amazon
__label__Positive	Cute
__label__Positive	This did just the trick and made a great gift for a loved one
__label__Positive	For Christmas I always like to add a surprise gift card to my childrens list of wants This one was adorable even for my adult children
__label__Negative	So sad that they cant send you the code via email as they do with items such as playstation network cards
__label__Positive	Very pleased with the ease of purchasing an on line egift card  No waiting
__label__Positive	I Love it 
I can shop from home Amazon has a lot to offer I recommend this gift card for everyone Whats not to love 
__label__Positive	My thanks to my Darling Wife and beautiful daughter for giving me a wonderful Fathers Day present Now I can buy more books I want Thanks Beautiful Ones
__label__Positive	It was as expected and had the full 25 dollars on it The downside is that this defeats the purpose of having an E gift card as you have to print it out to use it
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Neutral	Had a hard time applying multiple cards into one account and Airbnb customer service was really terrible I wouldnt recommend it
__label__Positive	5 stars
__label__Positive	I wanted Sephora certificates I understand the receivers got amazon certificates Is this correct
__label__Positive	as good as gift card get
__label__Positive	nice card but I wish there were more different choices to choose from Perfect xmas gift cant go wrong with this
__label__Positive	Great for free Nice looking
__label__Positive	Convenient
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a gift card but it the dobt have prime and your buying 100 gift card just get them the prime
__label__Positive	Great to get a quick gift
__label__Positive	All went well
__label__Negative	No matter that the einvoice and the enclosed packing list showed the message I requested the cards were blank no message no from whom line  All seven cards in sealed shipping envelopes were very neatly packed in a box with plastic fluff so they would not be broken in transithow thoughtful  These gift cards seemed a good idea at the time but NOOOO  Most things that seem to too good to be true usually are  Wont be fooled again

Jazzpicker
__label__Negative	Update it took a few minutes for Starbucks to register it All is well

When I got this card it wasnt preloaded Beware
__label__Positive	Easy to use Receiving party did not get email notification  but I was able to resend the ecard with no trouble at all
__label__Positive	Best way to get them that perfect gift
__label__Positive	The process was fast and easy
__label__Positive	If you know youre gonna be able to use the movie gift card add it on to any purchase that is under the 35 dollar limit for free shipping and then youll qualify for free shipping and save 
__label__Positive	Very funny and a great birthday card
__label__Positive	I would recommend to someone who reads alot It was great to have the certificate right away Thank you for your good service PeggyThis Survey is too long
__label__Positive	Love presentation tin
__label__Positive	love  gave away as gifts 
__label__Positive	Avoiding traffic at mega shopping center during Christmas
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card arrived on time and friends and family are always pleased to receive a gift they get to choose
__label__Positive	cute
__label__Positive	The process to buy this gift card was very easy and receive inmediatily this in my email i recoment buy this product is better to buy in amazon and more secure
__label__Positive	Always a perfect gift for my son
__label__Positive	Nice Christmas Holiday design with a free note card and envelope
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are great The product the company has is so diversified and sometimes if you dont know the person real well or if you dont know what they really need or they live far away this is the way to go They used my Baby Shower card to order a neat baby bathtub And showed it to me
__label__Positive	A neat way to take the stress out of shopping
__label__Positive	I gave this a 5 star rating because it is quick and easy  I get to pick the wrapping for this gift and it only took moments to complete  I love giving these printable cards to family and friends who love to read on their Kindle
__label__Positive	This was a gift  No complaints
__label__Positive	cute nice cardstock
__label__Positive	We always manage to be late with a gift for someone every Christmas  This is the perfect remedy  Amazon gets the gift card there on time even in a couple of days and lets me know it has been delivered  The perfect gift for those hard to buy for loved ones
__label__Negative	Sometimes I think I am a little too lenient and a little too nice  This card came ALL raggedy looking and bent up with creases and folds that looks like it was previously used and sat around for a year or two before official use or purchase  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME  The first three or four times I overlooked it and did NOT post a negative review  NOW I AM  I just ordered these gift cards so theres NO reason that two of them should be in the bent up worn conditions they are in  Hopefully Amazoncom will correct this nonsense that has happened MORE times thsn it should
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Fast delivery card work fine and would recommend and order from again Thanks
__label__Positive	What can one say about a Gift Card It was delivered promptly and packaged very nicely
__label__Positive	Sister love the gift card
__label__Positive	mum loved it
__label__Positive	Gift cards via email are the fastest way to gift someone the ability to grab a book from the Kindle Store
__label__Positive	To use the Netflix gift card you simply create a Netflix account and enter the code from the card  Once the code is entered you will have a balance that your bill will be deducted from  There is no contract with Netflix it is monthly  This makes an excellent gift for people who already have Netflix accounts since they can just apply it to their future bills  It is also a great gift for someone who does not have Netflix yet as it would cover up to a year of service  I am also really happy to see these are finally on Amazon as it used to be really tough to locate a store that carried Netflix cards and they were not sold online  The card comes exactly as shown in the product images  You geographical location makes no difference with this card so no matter where you live this will work

Netflix has a number of streaming plans as well as DVD rental plans

Streaming pricing plans
799 1 screen with standard definition no HD
999 2 screens with HD
1199 4 screens and Ultra HD
For all plans the first month is FREE

I have found that the streaming works very well I do have high speed internet  The Netflix streaming option is great for TV shows as well as movies  You wont find the latest movie releases in streaming though for that you would need a DVD plan  I also have Amazon Prime and have found having both services is great  Often Netflix will have something Amazon does not or vise versa

DVD plans currently offered range from 499 up to 1199  Although there used to be more expensive plans that allowed for more than 2 DVDs out at a time
With a DVD plan you are allowed to have 1 or 2 DVDs out at a time  They arrive in your mailbox in a prepaid return envelope so when you are done you just pop them back in your mailbox  As soon as Netflix receives the return they will ship out the next DVD in your Netflix DVD queue

DVD Plan pricing
499 1 disc at a time 2 per month
799 1 disc at a time unlimited per month
1199 2 discs at a time unlimited per month

It is wonderful not having to go anywhere to rent or return the movies

As a reminder you do not have to sign any contracts with Netflix it is month by month fee  You can cancel your account at any time and if you decide to activate it again in the future Netflix will load your old DVD queue back in
However once you load a gift card into your balance you can not cancel until the remaining balance of your gift card is depleted
__label__Positive	Excellent  the recipient was very pleased
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	made it in 24 hrs and it was a gift  So it was perfect timing Better than getting the credit from forever21 online Much better option to get card from here

__label__Positive	The perfect gift
__label__Positive	It seems strange to write a review for a gift card but this one comes in a tin so I guess it makes sense  I bought multiple gift cards in various styles  They all arrived the next day but one of them had a pretty sizable dent in it  It obviously wasnt worth it to send it back  Also be aware it has a preview window in the back so you can see the back of the card  I wouldnt recommend buying this with a plan to use the tin for anything else
__label__Positive	Great presentation
__label__Positive	I was so impressed to see it in my hand the next morning after ordering on light the evening before  A miracle
__label__Positive	great
__label__Negative	Wrong information from the amazon staff This item can not be used in other countries because of the currency

__label__Positive	The item appeared just as in the photo and arrived in a timely manner
__label__Positive	Super cute and sturdy for a gift bag
__label__Negative	Couldnt use unless printed out despite Android pay adding it to my wallet Once printed Safeway staff refused to type in the gift card number by hand
__label__Positive	Always an easy gift

__label__Positive	Its a gift card Not much else to say Arrived in 1 day so got it in plenty of time
__label__Positive	Arrived sooner than  scheduled  Fast shipping  Will order again
__label__Positive	Our grandchildren  in New York were so excited to get their gift card

__label__Positive	I recently purchased a Happy Birthday gift certificate for our daughterinlaw from Amazon  She shops often at Amazon and so was thrilled at the gift  With the great variety of gifts available on Amazon the gift certificate is so convenient and much appreciated by the recipient
  Thanks GJ
__label__Positive	Not much to say I am sure the receiver of this gift enjoyed it  The process to purchase it was smooth
__label__Neutral	The gift card was delivered in the timeframe noted However the package was opened and the gift card presentation backing was completely scratched as if it was dragged through the streets prior to shipping Hopefully this thing works
__label__Positive	Was great thanks
__label__Negative	This card is NOT reedemable sic for any restaurant around the country  To utilize the card you are directed to their website where you learn what if any restaurants in your zip code take this offer  In mine there were only a few restaurants even listed most are pizza and seedy joints in poor strip centers exclusively  Not only that you cant apply the card to the entire order  it only gets you a small 5 10 discount toward your check which must be in excess of a high threshhold  Example  good for 5 off check of 3750 or more  Imagine how many times you would have to go to disgusting tiny restaurants to use up the 100 value of the card  If I could have awarded negative stars this offer sure deserves it  Amazon you should know better than to sell a nonproduct like this
__label__Positive	This came in a really cute box As a last minute birthday gift it was a nice surprise
__label__Positive	This is the best gift card you can get from Amazon  Five stars  Dont say anything not positive about Amazon they dont like it  If youre unable to read this then I rest my case  But if you are able to read this then the Shell gift card has the highest resale value at 99  And I was wrong about the other thing and I apologize  Amazon your awesome  Are we good now
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	Very pretty and appropriate
__label__Positive	Best way to say Happy Birthday to friends
__label__Positive	Came quickly works as promised

__label__Positive	We bought this gift card at a slight discount  We have a Buca di Peppo in SouthlakeGrapevine area of Texas  We love to go there occasionally and wish it was not such a drive for us  They offer such large portions you will have plenty for later  The food has all been great when we have gone there  One thing that is nice about a gift card is that you can combine it with any coupons you might have  Sign up for their email list and they will send you some  Try the Carbonara its my favorite
__label__Negative	I bought 2 Buffalo Wild Wings gift cards and neither of them had money on them talk about embarrassing when you get a call saying that the gift card you gave do not work

__label__Positive	The product is great just the gift tag was awful
__label__Positive	cute tin
__label__Positive	A1
__label__Negative	I bought this gift card for Mothers Day with promised delivery the day before on Saturday  When it was not delivered on Saturday I checked the tracking number and it listed the estimated delivery as Wednesday one week after I placed my order  I called Amazon who put me on hold to contact Fedex  Amazon said that they could have it there by Monday the day after Mothers Day and that was the best that they could do  Feeling horrible that my mother wasnt going to get a gift for Mothers Day I called her and told her it would be there the next day  It was actually delivered Tuesday evening  Honestly its a gift cardwhy would it take a week to get there  There was no inclement weather or any other reason for the delay  This is the last time I will order a gift card here  Next time I will just go the store and mail a gift card myselfat least I know it will get there in a couple of days
__label__Positive	Always a nice gift to send I like being able to treat distant relatives to a little lunch sometimes

__label__Positive	This was very nice quick gift for an acquaintance who was retiring Not as personalized as something I would get for a closeclose friend but for a casual association it was nice and fit in the card It also allowed her to make her own choice on a purchase
__label__Negative	I selected this and when I clicked on print the image was the a symbol  I wanted the apple and welcome back that I selected
__label__Positive	Daughter was able to  register her gift card right away and waited to use it after finalizing her decision on what to purchase No chance to lose it somewhere
__label__Positive	We bought these for our employees as Christmas gifts The card was very nice with lots of room to write notes  They were delivered the next day so service was fast Nice for gifts if you dont  know what to get  Will do it again next year

__label__Positive	Convenient and just works

__label__Positive	What a great way to get a last minute gift Click and print your own gift card in the amount that you want Cute picture choices to personalize Fast easy and it makes shopping for that hard to buy for person easy they choose their own gift
__label__Negative	I give it two stars only because the restaurant food is so good It took three calls to get the gift card actually delivered Had I not been close to the recipient I could well have gone on thinking all was well and not known the card was not actually deliveredgreat for the restaurant which would never have had to fulfill the gift card Only by calling Amazon to intercede did I get the card delivered and that was on the third call How embarrassing to have to check with the recipient each time to see if they actually got their present Not very cool
__label__Positive	The receiver of this card liked the Fairy display
__label__Positive	It was delivered right on time It was so easy to buy I love it my husband was able to use it also with out any problems I will be using your services again

__label__Positive	Sent online gift card to mothertobe who is out of state  she was able to order items
__label__Positive	I bought a gift card for a graduate  I couldnt find an Amazon plastic gift card in my local stores and I like to send a card with a personal note so I printed out a gift card and enclosed it  It gave the gift a bit more of a personal touch than your traditional gift card purchase
__label__Positive	I bought this gift card with an Amazon gift card As soon as I received this card I verified it wasnt a JCP Sephora card those can only be used at JCP instores and not online and it passed that test and then I went to Sephoracom and verified the card had funds loaded and it did I went right to shopping and didnt look back
__label__Positive	These were greatly appreciated by the recipients who used them to buy music so they could listen to it on their Echo units
__label__Positive	Exactly what I was looking for given as a gift

__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	It was so easy and my family members loved it
__label__Positive	I give these all the time and everyone just loves them  When you cant think of what to give these are perfect
__label__Negative	This is only for online lowescom orders  I sent this to a parent but it was a difficult process to use it as the local store turned them away without any help  A birthday gift that turned out to be a lot of headaches to walk them through purchasing online  It also cant be returned so I wasnt able to return and get them a physical gift card
__label__Positive	Arrived in my brotherinlaws inbox very quickly
__label__Positive	My husband gave me this card for my birthday and I really enjoyed purchasing this and that  some from my wish list some not But I did find some great deals love those books for 1 cent
__label__Positive	You can never go wrong with an Amazon GC as a gift  As far as I am concerned it is the best gift ever  This particular one the Merry Christmas Pine is particularly pretty

__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	i like it fast shipping
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like an Amazon Gift Card
__label__Positive	I do not have to leave the house to purchase the gift card and Amazon makes the process so easy and the best part is Amazon has so many choices I know whomever I give the gift card to will find something they want
__label__Positive	I was a little hesitant but this printed easily
I wouldnt hesitate to try again  An easy idea for a gift
__label__Negative	I found the quality of sheets to be great however I expected to find 4 pillowcases as is the norm now from most companies  Additionally the
outside of the packaging showed a nice trim but when I opened the package the trim was only on the two pillowcases and the heading on the top sheet was a sparse inch and a half at most  What a disappointment  Oh well next time I will check the manufacturer closer
__label__Positive	Superb
__label__Positive	Almost everybody knows someone that loves a Starbucks gift card
__label__Positive	My husband loved his ecard for Lowes He is always going to Lowes and appreciated the card
__label__Positive	As I live in another country outside of the USA buying gifts for my grandchildren who live there  became a problem  As birthdays and special occasions came along I had no idea what to buy them as I was unsure what they had and what their likes and dislikes were  Purchasing a gift card was easy and they now enjoy chosing their own gifts
__label__Positive	Gift was given and surprised the recipient
__label__Positive	I managed to send an Amazon gift card for a late b day and the reciepient was so pleased because they were able to get exactly what they wanted  Its fast convenient and very effective at solving those last minute guft worries make someone smile send them an Amazon gift ceritifcate  Very pleased it landed in their inbox in next to no time 
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Three of our grandsons had requested Amazoncom gift cardsso much easier for me vs having to do shopping wrapping and worrying if they were going to be happy with their presents  No worries with Amazoncom gift card  It is the perfect size color and no wrapping
__label__Positive	It was the perfect birthday gift  The recipient liked it because they could use it to purchase books etc  for their Kindle
__label__Positive	Nice Pics
__label__Positive	Great simple way to get gift cards without going to the store
__label__Positive	Satisfied
__label__Positive	My grandson loved it

__label__Positive	Wonderfully fast  Easy gift giving 
__label__Positive	This card is perfect for the inlaws to use on there mornings out or on the way to see family at the coast
__label__Negative	Says its accepted at 150000 locations Hotelscom is estimated to have about 500000 So do the math But in my experience it was worse than that I tried to use my 150 card in two different cities Not accepted at any hotel I wanted to stay in  This is the stuff classaction lawsuits are made of
__label__Positive	Great way to get someone a sameday gift that they can use as they please No tag sale retreads
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with Nordstrom  Quick shipping
__label__Negative	I was unimpressed with the online gift card email delivery  Thought an Amazon gift card with a special picture would be a great gift for my MotherinLaw right to her email so I purchased it in advance of her birthday  Per the option on Amazon to deliver it to her email on a scheduled day I scheduled for email delivery to her on her birthday

When I checked in with her on her birthday she had not received it at all She also checked her junkspam folder although she is already an Amazon customer and nothing there  When I contacted Amazon about it they apologized for the mistake and thought there must have been a glitch in their internal system  They were nice about it and corrected it but the element of surprise and timeliness of delivery was a fail

No concessions were offered and just got an apology  I dont feel confident to purchase an online gift card as an option again
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are always a convenient safe way to give a gift They always arrive on time and are easy to redeem
__label__Positive	Smooth transaction
__label__Positive	The Santa Suit gift card tin was a great addition to the gift card  My son in law actually did ask if the tin came with it He liked it
__label__Positive	Well received by receiver Very easy
__label__Positive	And very convenient
__label__Negative	Were is it
__label__Positive	quick and easy  printed it out and was ready to go  no travel to the store etc  would be great for those looking for easy OR for those who are looking for a last minute gift
__label__Positive	last minute gifts
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	Buying whatever I want
__label__Positive	bien
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Received the cards in about a week  They can be used at any of the Outbacks  corporate brand restaurants  Like the option of buying in 25 increments
__label__Positive	Made a great gift
__label__Positive	Its very convenient and I really like that I could buy it  only about 5 minutes later the recipient  usally will receive it it said  I can choose as low a 1I also like that you can pic out a animated greeting to go with it at no extra cost So I decided to try it out with 5 with the animated butterfly  Birthday greeting that Amazon list Glad I didshe enjoyed it very much  also she was able to redeemed the 500 and left a thank you note to me when she did This was perfect for my Situation cause her birthday packages wouldnt arrive till after her Birthdayso this way she got a gift on her Birthday  there fore ends up with one more gift  At least  that was my experience but you may have a different experience though Con text message may accidentally get deletedso might want to warn them ahead time to watch for it And send not very much money at one timehope this helps
__label__Positive	It was a wonderful gift from my husband for my birthday I am still using it as I see something I want I will continue to use it as I find things or books I want
__label__Positive	Easy to use and quick to print
__label__Positive	My father is incredibly difficult to select gifts for  When he wants something he gets it himself  He never asks for anything  However he is a voracious reader  His Kindle saved the family home from the evergrowing pile of  books  So the perfect gift for Dad  more to read  This gift card was easy to print and looked really nice  Plus Dad was super happy to be able to pick his own book
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for our amazon prime daughter
__label__Positive	Exactly as expected
__label__Positive	I gave this gift card as a baby gift and my friend loved it  So fun for her to choose the books she read as a child for her new baby  Im planning on giving this for everything from now onbirthdays holidays graduation anniversariesso convenient and you know it will be appreciated
__label__Positive	Exactly what I was looking for  Great holiday tin
__label__Positive	ummm its a gift card  why are there even reviews for these  LMFAO
__label__Negative	I received a Starbucks gift card as a Christmas gift and for close to two weeks I have tried to place an online order and keep getting the message that due to maintenance gift cards can not be accepted as payment for purchases and to try again at another time

__label__Positive	Super easy to use on both kindle books and any other item you want to buy I would definitely buy them as gifts for others
__label__Positive	Not happy with Amazons services I can not transfer my amazon gift card balance to my friends or familys account once it had been redeemed on my account
__label__Positive	These would make for an excellent stocking stuffer gift or get a few and pass them out to coworkers  I love that they come in multiples of three  You can either give one package to a family as a gift or you can break them up and hand them out individually as gifts
__label__Positive	pizzzza

__label__Positive	A
__label__Positive	These gift cards are very convenient to use for friends andor relative who live a great distances  The recipients two very savvy preteens were very happy to have money to spend on Amazoncom
__label__Positive	I ordered this gift card for just what it is a 25 gift card I got just that 25 to put towards movies and it was ready to go I have seen many complaints about the convenience fee that Fandango charges to purchase movie tickets However that charge applies to every purchase and is in no relation to using a gift card I would have liked to have been able to use the card at my theater but theaters dont except them which is also not related to this gift card I should have purchased a gift card directly from my theater if I had issues not being able to use this card at my theater Even with the fees I was able to purchase two movie tickets and not have to spend anymore Tickets at my theater are only 10 each or 800 for the matinee  I have also seen complaints about not being able to spend the even amount on the card That is the case with any gift card You usually either put the total amount towards the bill and pay the remaining with another form of payment or you dont spend the whole amount just use what is left over towards your next bill All in all I was satisfied with what I expected and what I received
__label__Positive	Great Gift
__label__Positive	Great Gift
__label__Positive	Always great he loved it
__label__Positive	This was the perfect gift for my sisters anniversary  She lives quite far away from me so this was a great option and she said she actually had her eye on an item from Amazon so the certificate would really help  Will definitely be sending more certificates to family and friends as gifts
__label__Positive	Came with a nice tin for the gift card  Received the gift card quickly
__label__Positive	Looks great as a gift
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love money in a tin holder to spend at Amazon
__label__Negative	Bought this for my mother

The card was hard to loadshe couldnt do it without my help

Then we couldnt figure out how to make 1click purchases go against the gift card instead of the credit card

And then to make matters worse the price was 300 more for EVERY book she had looked at in the evening when I was there to help her than in the daytime when she had shopped  Its been two weeks and we still havent been able to find a way to buy these books at the price she should be able to pay

This combined with a recent support issues leaves me VERY disappointed in Amazon where I was once a raving favourable customer

__label__Positive	Very good Thank you
__label__Positive	Perfect for my graduate
__label__Negative	SCAM

NOT KIDDING Dont buy this
__label__Negative	The gift card was declined But Amazon did credit my account
__label__Positive	Gift cards shipped as loose cards in poly bag nothing to write on for gift
__label__Positive	Son in law was happy

__label__Positive	This is an excellent way to gift someone on the spur of the moment and get it to them right away
__label__Positive	Very cute Love Hoops and Yoyo

__label__Positive	this is the third time that I am here to write an review for the gift card because the first time I want to show it in Chinese but it cant be posted I dont know why as attached picture I didnt say anything bad
__label__Positive	Whats not to love about a gift card
__label__Positive	Easy and fun gift idea
__label__Positive	Great gift to give
__label__Negative	Some how it got duplicated
__label__Positive	It was delivered next day as promised and my friend loved her present  Like me she enjoys Amazoncom because there are so many choices  I was very happy with this delivery and product
__label__Positive	Simple easy and fast for a last minute gift especially when they live across the country This way they can pick out exactly what they want
__label__Negative	Save all the time and thinking required to shop for meaningful gifts Buy this corporate crap today
__label__Positive	Got this as gift card for my best friend who lives across the country and she used it the same day
__label__Positive	Thanks for making Fathers Day so easy  My Dad has a Kindle so he will most likely use it for a new book  With Amazon I have opened up endless possibilities for him
__label__Negative	Because Amazon sent one that couldnt be activated They told me they sent another expedient mail but only sent one and not the entire order I had to call again they again promised me overnight two days later  STILL WAITING I SHOULDNT HAVE TO WAIT FOR A GIFT CARD I ORDERED ON DEC 2 STILL WAITING ON DECEMBER 13
__label__Positive	very cool light
__label__Negative	Need some waffles
__label__Negative	I cant say much because the cards I purchased never made it  Amazon needs to charge a little more and use a service that works  Several packages did not make it in time for Christmas  UPS just doesnt care
__label__Positive	The gift card was for my young nephew to be able to get things for his Kindle Fire  He loved it
__label__Positive	Bought it as a Birthday present and they love it  No problems what so ever
__label__Positive	Great way to send gifts during this time of the year
__label__Positive	For my boys they loved the cards
__label__Positive	Love having this option for faraway folks and last minute gifts

Apparently those ordinary looking gifcards are as valuable as dinosaurs artifacts

Very disappointing indeed
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always the best present for those persons who like picking out their own special items
__label__Positive	Fantastic way to give gifts to people going overseas Something Flipkart doesnt allow us to do Way to go

__label__Positive	Easy access for ordering and process simple great gift for someone to buy what they want from almost any venue
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong I know gift cards are considered impersonal but if you really dont know what to buy amazoncom gift cards fit everyone They can use it for needs such as food or just about anything they want
__label__Positive	Nice way to get the person who has everything something for Christmas
__label__Positive	This was a great companion to the Kindle for a Christmas Gift Just give the a gift certificate and let them load their Kindle with their choice of reading material

__label__Positive	Daughter loved it

__label__Positive	Glad to have it
__label__Negative	Pain in the butt card cannot be used on the app or at restaurant kiosks an employee has to enter the card number
__label__Positive	The winter design is allinclusive great for giving to friends who dont celebrate Christmas or anything that you still want to buy for
__label__Positive	Came with a nifty birthday card and envelope
__label__Positive	My grandchildren are of the age when Im not sure what to give them  An amazon gift card shows a bit more thought than cash and they always find something they want
__label__Positive	excellent
__label__Positive	Cool case for the most useful gift card possible
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Positive	Amazing way to quickly put a smile on someones face
__label__Positive	great last minute gift  quick and easy

__label__Positive	I love this gift card  Its very creative and cute

__label__Positive	Nice and easy to use
__label__Positive	My husband loves getting amazon gift cards
He likes buying books for his kindle
I really like ths free case and looked very festive
__label__Positive	always good  fast delivery
__label__Negative	Cute idea but the tin is not reusable The bottom is cut open and a piece of plastic interested so the barcode can be scanned What a waste
__label__Negative	They didnt refund me my money  manipulating me for returning me the money on the original payment discover card
__label__Positive	easy last minute gift Just point and click I printed it and placed it into the birthday card Doesnt get any easier
__label__Positive	Got for a special person  he chose something Id never have thought of So glad he chose  not me
__label__Positive	the expected
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	This is a great way to go if you arent sure what to buy for a birthday gift  There are so many different products to buy on Amazon that it offered the gift card recipient so many choices I needed the card in a hurry and requested a two day delivery  It came the next day  Terrific service and it was greatly appreciated
__label__Positive	My nephew wanted money or an Amazon gift card for his birthday  I never feel safe sending money in the mail so I opted for an egift card It was super  Arrived on time and my nephew was thrilled and got what he wanted and I didnt have to worry about postage or gas and a trip to the mall
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are great gifts  It took me only one day to receive this card  Sometimes it is quicker to order using my Amazon app than to stop at Walgreens
__label__Positive	My niece love this gift card  Of course I dont think anyone would turn down a gift card especially amazon  do I get coupons for that  lol
__label__Positive	What can I say it worked when it arrived and it came on time
__label__Positive	everyone loved getting them for Christmas  Thanks
__label__Positive	Everybody loves a gift card  I just hope I get one of these for Kwanza or Christmas or whenever I can
__label__Positive	This was a great present for our childs significant other Not only does it assure that they will be able to find something that they want it is also extremely easy It seems a more personal gift than just handing someone cash Great for those last minute pop up guests as well It only takes about 15 minutes to receive the email verification and print out your gift card For me it took longer to select the card and write the sentiment than receiving the approval email Great product thanks Amazon
__label__Negative	its not sending
__label__Positive	Its always the best option when you have to send something at least for me  Especially last minute or as an acknowledgment gift
__label__Positive	Our friends truly loved the gift card and had never received one like this before
It did have a bit of trouble getting there but that was my fault I guess as I had typed
a wrong character in the address line for them to email it too  I called and got it
all taken of within a matter of 20 minutes and it was all good
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	My recipients are very happy with it
__label__Negative	How can you not like an Amazon gift card I ordered it for my nephew who was leaving the country for an extended period I ordered it and was going to just get the email version but they guaranteed next day delivery  So I figured fine even if they miss that Ive got another day to play with But NOOOOOOOOOO for the first time ever Amazon blows it completely and doesnt deliver literally
A real disappointment
__label__Positive	Well what can I say Best gift I could give
__label__Positive	I always send my niece an Amazon gift card so she can buy books for her Kindle  Its fast easy and is always delivered on time
__label__Positive	This is an interesting way to not go out and buy a gift card
__label__Positive	An awesome gift for anyone
__label__Positive	As expected
__label__Positive	I purchased this gift certificate on line and was able to download it within minutes to give to my friend I have always loved buying from amazoncom because their things come in a very timely manner and I have never been disappointed in anything I have ordered
__label__Positive	My son and granddaughter love them
__label__Positive	Delivery was faster than expected all cards were working
__label__Positive	excelent my gift
__label__Positive	Recipient loved this gift
__label__Positive	A good discount card
__label__Positive	This item was okay It printed like 480p and didnt have HDMI would have been nice for the price Also the fold here lines were hard to hit Otherwise it was good
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Saved 10  Thats all it was and all I wanted
__label__Negative	It took 2 weeks to get this gift card
__label__Positive	xms present
__label__Positive	Thanks Amazon for making discounted gift cards available
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Positive	Works as advertised
__label__Positive	Great gift card
__label__Positive	This final book mocks society in the turnaround that occurs  Humanity wins  The hint of lingering mental illness is a strength
__label__Positive	Very fast delivery
__label__Positive	exelent
__label__Positive	I love the these
__label__Negative	EPIC FAILURE by Amazon Details later when I have a halfhour to texttype details Ordered Dec 14th for Christmas gift After numerous fails on Amazon Customer Services part I STILL dont have a functional gift card God only knows what my Visa bill is going to look like AMAZON HAS REPEATEDLY CHANGEDCHARGED MY ORDERCARD WITHOUT MY PERMISSION DESPITE REPEATED REQUESTS TO CANCEL ORDER Now that I could maybe actually complete giving my Christmas gift 3 days past Christmas and itll be at least 24 more hours and I HAVENT asked them to cancel their latest screwup they probably will What a joke disguised as customer service
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and worked great
__label__Positive	While I dont like giving gift cards too impersonal this card makes up for it Amazon has everything
__label__Positive	Did not know what to buy as gift
This was  the perfect present 
__label__Positive	It an easy to do gift for someone living away and not have to search for it in the store
__label__Positive	One of the easiest things Ive accomplished online Thanks My sister loved it and was anxious to start shopping Will probably do this again
__label__Positive	This is the kind of buy I will have to repeat year after year Sure money whenever I need to spend with a limit but with a myiriad of products to choose from
__label__Positive	Five stars amazing purchase and it was shipped VERY FAST each card was already activated I WILL BE BUYING THIS ITEM AGAIN
__label__Positive	Sent as a gift and Sister loved it
__label__Positive	Amazing gift card

__label__Positive	Friend loved it
__label__Positive	Perfect spur of the moment gift for my friend He was going abroad and this way hed have something portable to read on his Kindle
__label__Positive	People can buy whatever they want with these gift cards and Amazon sells everything so they make the perfect gift I like that they dont deduct ripoff fees from the amount the way some other types of gift cards do
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	GREAT
__label__Positive	my daughter loved it
__label__Negative	SUNGLASS HUT HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE DO NOT BUY FROM SUNGLASS HUT BUY DIRECTLY FROM THE VENDORDO NOT BUY THIS GIFT CARD BUY SOMETHING ELSE FROM AMAZON INSTEAD

Long story short what was a simple problem gift cards were locked turned into hours of phone calls with customer service at Sunglass Hut The summary they never were able to unlock the cards for me and had no other solution Never received a call from the supervisor that was promised to me twice I am hoping Amazon will issue me credit for these purchases because their customer service is actually really helpful compared to my Sunglass Customer Service experience which was similar to being exposed to a flesh eating bacteria virus while having someone bang your head against a wall until you cant remember your name

Take my word you do not want this gift card Buy a roomba on Amazon Prime instead Or maybe even buy an Amazon gift card for a friend Just dont buy this gift card I promise you will be miserable if you do
__label__Positive	Very convenient super easy to use
__label__Positive	I loved the fact that this gift card had a cute display box with it at no extra charge  It arrived on time and only had a minor dent which is to be expected and popped right out  Loved it

__label__Positive	Gift cards are great always fit they feel fairly unimaginative but at least the person gets something they wantlike  They are easy to pick up and they are always on time if you are
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	My sonin law is difficult to buy for He is constantly receiving orders from Amazonso I know when I give him a gift card it will be used I also like the fact that you can personalize the ecard

__label__Positive	I love the gift card of Amazon they are very useful and they send very fast to the email
__label__Positive	Good restaurant worth at least one visit The food is decent but kind of pricey You definitely pay for the atmosphere and location My 2 12 year old loved it though which makes it worth every penny

__label__Positive	Ordered it on Tuesday  They had it on Wednesday  Perfect
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	Came right away I was very pleased
__label__Positive	This product was ordered on the 18th and was received on the 23rd even though it was supposed to be two day shipping Im very glad that I ordered them so early because they are Christmas gifts and that could have caused an issue for me That maybe something that Amazon may want to take into consideration I also was unsatisfied with the tins the gift cards came in They appear to be just normal gift card tins but they have a window in them that shows that its a gift card I just found that a bit tacky and thought the gift tine would look better without it I xan deal with that but nothing was said about it in the description Still it does the job but taking off a star for delivery and product description Just a lil disapointed in amazon
__label__Positive	No extra postage
No worrying if it arrived or not
Emails in minutes
Grandbaby loved the music and animation
Everyone loves shopping Amazon
__label__Positive	best giftcardpresent ever little shipping box is clever

__label__Positive	Multiple adult children inlaws and friends find this a great way to receive their Christmas wishes One size fits all
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	The gift card enabled me to get a great and appreciated Birthday gift to a grand child from the east to the west coast  You know it will get there when you request the date delivered
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	gift card for a friend
__label__Positive	Happy grand daughter
__label__Positive	Yes
__label__Negative	Buyer be Aware I purchased this gift card from Amazon on January 21st I tried to use it today to be told that it had a zero balance I called Amazon and they told me too bad They can not reissue me a new card even though Nordstrom can verify that funds were removed from the card before I ever purchased it In other words Amazon sold me a card for 50 with a zero balance on the card I have appealed their decision and am awaiting a decision I have talked to no less than 4 representatives from Amazon today None of them have been able to fix this issue
__label__Positive	Always liked by family and friends
__label__Positive	one of my faves
__label__Positive	A bit pricey but well worth it 
__label__Positive	Great for you or the people in your life that appreciate quality foods  and have no qualms about the cost GREAT store for the bespoked foodie class
__label__Positive	I have been using Claritin for years and it is very effective in controlling my allergies  I appreciate Amazon keeping this in their pharmacy and the fact that I can get it so quickly  Thank you Amazon
__label__Negative	Amazon wont let you use your existing account balance to purchase these  I feel manipulated and while I have been a regular Amazon purchaser in the past this has left a bad taste in my mouth  I wouldnt go through with the purchase but I need the card in a couple of hours
__label__Positive	very soft my  kids like it
__label__Positive	So convenient When you dont know what to get this always works
__label__Positive	It was so easy to order and send without having to mail to the birthday person Made Birthday shopping easy at Amazoncom
__label__Negative	This gift card never came and our grandson was very disappointed  We are accustom to fast delivery from Amazon and couldnt understand all the Emails gift had not shipped
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	What a great way to present a gift card to that special someone without having to run to a store to buy one It was easy to download and print the card design and to add a the actual gift card in any of a number of  amounts without a fee some stores charge a fee in addition to the gift card amount that you buy dumbI liked the fact that the gift recipient could use the card for any purchase on Amazon without worrying about an expiration date These cards come in several choice options like holidays birthdays mothers day etc
__label__Positive	Because of the wide scope of Amazon vendors the gift card is the One fits all answer to gift buying problems for all occasions
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt want to get a gift card  I loved the container very clever
__label__Positive	Got some good stuff
__label__Positive	Awesome gift
__label__Negative	Cashier said that the card would not work  It has a scratch on the bar code
__label__Positive	I like the packaging for gift cards  The quality is a lot better than expected  The convenience of having these cards directly deposited to another member is great but I like to be personal when giving these cards in person  The printed variety is great  They dont look like a dollar store generic card either  Kudos to that  I dont like giving people generic looking gift cards
__label__Positive	Got it for a niece and it was easy to buy  If there are any issues with this then I will update
__label__Neutral	Didnt work  Amazon refunded
__label__Positive	Great as a gift
__label__Positive	Everything I wanted it to be My daughter loved it and it arrived exactly as I requested Would recommend to  everyone

__label__Positive	Easy to use and send  Great for the family and friends you dont know what to get for a gift Also great for the person who has everything
__label__Positive	Animation was excellent and delightful  Recipient loves his gift card

__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	I love this product its the best
__label__Positive	My son loved it  He uses Kindle for iPad so we allowed him to use daddys email to shop for books
__label__Neutral	An option to buy a card for a round number eg AUD 50 would be appreciated Converting fifty US dollars to Aussie dollars resulted in giving an odd amount
__label__Positive	The perfect last minute present
__label__Positive	This arrived quickly No hiccups at all We were able to redeem the electronic gift card instore with no issues at all
__label__Positive	Yes it printed well and folded into a nice card there could of been some warning about exchange rates etc from aus dollars to US dollars thats my only winge

__label__Positive	Awesomeness
__label__Positive	I was out of state on Fathers day but the electronic gift card made a great present It was extremely easy to send and is customizable to make it a little more special than just a gift card You can pick out an ecard to go along with it and write a personal message to whoever youre sending it to
__label__Positive	Bought one for each college student 2 to get some college supplies or a book or maybe  2 Books are so expensive
__label__Positive	Ive had quite a few of these cards Mostly as presents but I recently bought a few off of another site that was having a 15 off of 75 purchase special

The process only takes about a minute I usually set up my tee time through the course website like I normally would Then fill out the form on the Go Play Golf website with all the info from my tee time The day before I play I get an email saying that a gift certificate has been bought at the course in my name and then the info of the person at the course When I check in at the course I tell them my name and they should have a GC for me They get it and thats it Never had a problem in the 25 times I have used them

I wouldnt buy this for myself without the discount since it wouldnt make much sense but as a gift for somebody else it is perfect because then they can play whichever course they want If you have a balance on the card that doesnt cover the cost of a round at the course you just fill out the request like normal and they will buy a GC in the amount you have left No carryover or lost money There are no fees associated with using it either It would be nice if they could be reloaded instead of always having to buy new ones but thats a pretty small thing
__label__Neutral	Did not have gift card holder
__label__Positive	Quick and easy gift for those special people in your life
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for a daughter who has everything
__label__Positive	For my kindle friends this is the only gift to give Who doesnt love money to spend on something they love
__label__Positive	great I got 10 bucks extra
__label__Positive	This is awesome Didnt have time to send anything to my mom for mothers day and she used it the very next day  She was happy 
__label__Positive	Great stocking stuffers for my grown children
__label__Positive	My grandson loves Amazon cards
__label__Neutral	Its not like the ecards are being printed on plastic Why arent there more options I think there were only two or three for weddings None for wedding showers And none of the graphics were all that great Very disappointed with the selection for ecards
__label__Positive	I love the fact that amazon sells gift cards to major retailers so that I dont have to go to the store Its also great for last minute gift ideas
__label__Positive	Boyfriend totally loved this idea for Valentines day I would only suggest that there is some way that the receiver is notified not to delete the emailhe was going to delete since he receives so many emails from Amazon until he seen the personalzied picture on the gift card
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Negative	I do not have a local restaurant where I live so I purchased their frozen meals in a bag  What a rip off  I  bought the Beef with Broccoli meal  When you open the bag it looks like you have a lot of big beef chunks in it  NO  Its gravy shaped into the size of beef and there is literally maybe 2 pieces of  actual beef This proves they are rip off artists out to con anyone they can anytime
__label__Positive	great easy
__label__Negative	I was unable to use this although it was put it on my account This is partly Claires fault because there were website errors but do not buy unless you test it first
__label__Positive	Everything I expected
__label__Positive	Great Quick shipping
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Received the email quickly and was eating pizza at home in no time
__label__Positive	fun
__label__Positive	Great gift giving idea
__label__Positive	Loved the animated frog
__label__Positive	Convenient
__label__Positive	Got a 50 for 40 on special and it was a great Secret Santa gift with some candy and a small bottle of adult spirits to add some fun to a movietheatre soda 
__label__Positive	The Nativity Scene on this Christmas Gift Card was perfect  Just what I was looking for  I will use it again this upcoming Christmas
__label__Positive	Very nice tin
__label__Positive	It was a last minute idea and it worked easily I had to register as a new customer too It still was fast and easy Thanks for making it so easy
__label__Positive	Arrived on time great buy
__label__Positive	Always the right size color Free shipping Never had one to return Always in stock
__label__Positive	The card AND the packaging were shiny and new when they arrived My only concern is purely cosmetic the right side of the decorative orange bow was wider than the left side and I couldnt fix that by pulling the left side of the bow outwards because the center of the bow was glued in place but from what I can see the person who received this gift card is quite satisfied with its spending power

I would definitely recommend this to a friend
__label__Positive	It was a gift to someone and they loved it I plan to continue giving these to my favorite people when it comes their birthday time Its a great idea and saves me from having to hunt up a card in the store and not finding one suitable enough
__label__Positive	What a great way to give a gift to someone My relatives all received gift cards this year and not one of them complained They were all happy with this unique way of giving at Christmas time
__label__Positive	Loved ALL of it I bought many and will do the same again Bravo Anaxon
__label__Positive	Daughter loved it
__label__Positive	The picture printed beautifully with vibrant color It added a personal touch to the gift card that you cant get in stores
__label__Positive	Quick Shipping and I didnt have any issues using it
__label__Positive	My daughter loved the gift card from one of her favorite stores
__label__Positive	A fun gift
__label__Positive	Oh come on How cute is this
__label__Positive	The diamond plate box made the gift card seem much more substantial
__label__Positive	Picking and purchasing is so easy Now you can always send gift cards on time or last minute for any occassion
__label__Positive	Was the kind of funny fun gift card I was looking for
__label__Positive	Loved these cute tins  I was lazy this year and just did gift cards but who doesnt love an amazon gift card  It was nice to be able to send something cheerful for under the tree  My family loved them and said they would keep the tins to regift other cards next year  Total win
__label__Positive	I CHOSE IT FOR A BIRTHDAY IT DID EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID ON THE TIN OR GLASS IN THIS CASE
__label__Positive	GREAT
__label__Positive	Great and swift gift
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	What can I say you cant go wrong with gift cards for occasions and this gift card is a favorite of college kids

I gave this gift card as a gift and was really pleased with it  It is just a plain gift card but trust me your recipient will love it  When I gave this card to my son he was delighted  You know how many meals he can get especially if he eats off the dollar menu  Taco Bell has a really nice dollar menu and the food is filling  Two burritos and a drink will cost you three dollars and will make a pretty filling and satisfying lunch

All in all he LOVED this gift card  There was no guessing the right size getting the wrong item and even if he has a double of these hell still be happy  I highly recommend a Taco Bell card for anyone  Male Female old or youngit makes the perfect gift

Disclaimer  I paid full price for this item and this is my honest and unbiased review  All opinions are my own based on personal experience
__label__Negative	I dont like thesethey dont work very well for gifts  They dont look very Christmasy there is no place to write whom its to whom its from or a little note plus the code and serial numbers show through an opening in the back which is ugly
__label__Positive	gr8 way to shop1
__label__Positive	teen daughter loved it
__label__Positive	Makes a great giftthey loved it
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Its a gift card that does exactly what its supposed to
__label__Positive	cool gift
__label__Positive	It was my first time purchasing a CG online and what a super convenient way to send it via email without leaving your house
__label__Positive	Great idea for my Alaska dauinlaw who had an Amazon gift picked out and we didnt have to pay the shipping 
__label__Positive	This is the best gift I could gift my friends familythey can buy whatever they need from the Amazon storethis is so easy to apply online and redeem itthis is my 5th gift card that Im opting for my friendsI would certainly recommend this instead of buying some stuffs
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	fast and exact
__label__Positive	Great for grabs and nieces and nephews 
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	is what I require for my excellent team thank you very much for its speed I am from Venezuela h
__label__Positive	Love the variety of cards Im able to send
__label__Negative	Amazon duplicated my order but then reversed what I thought was the duplicate order  Instead they reversed the original order which is the gift card I gave as a gift  Recently when the recipient tried to use it they were told the card had been cancelled  I gave the original cards I received as the gifts because I thought the duplicates would be the ones that would have been cancelled and I did not check them before gifting due to a label that had to be removed  This has been a great inconvenience me and I will probably not order Amazon gift cards in the future  I love shopping on Amazon and the deals available there  However in the future I think cash is the better choice for a gift so as the person receiving the gift is not inconvenienced I do have the other cards but have not had a chance to give them to the recipients to see if those ones work  I will definitely let you know if they do not work as I did pay for two gift cards
__label__Positive	Its an Amazon card How can you go wrong
__label__Positive	my go to gift for everybody
__label__Positive	Easy to make print Thanks
__label__Positive	Amazon has great quality gift tins at no extra charge It is also nice that amazon has matched card graphics to fit in with the tin you order I love these tins as there is no gift wrapping required and the colors are really nice
__label__Positive	Good product and timely delivery good transaction all around
__label__Negative	Our gift cards were stolen by my mothers care giver  After many furustrating calls with Amazon the funds cannot be recovered  We will be diversifying our business away from Amazon
__label__Positive	It is exactly what it says it is
__label__Positive	This Santa Gift Card box was included with the purchase of a 50 Amazon gift card

Perfect packaging for a Christmas gift Whats not to like

Kathleen form Ronkonkoma NY
__label__Positive	I pretty much did all my Christmas shopping on Amazon and this was just so convenient to buy and have shipped to my house I will definitely be buying more gift cards on Amazon in the future
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love a gift card It posted on her wall and mine but thats it
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Very cute Perfect for my deer hair stylist at Christmas He got a chuckle out if it  so did I
__label__Positive	The box is so cute Its magnetic
__label__Positive	I am glad I requested the cards My kids are always letting me know last minute that their friend is having a birthday I have been able to add  to a cards and put in a birthday card Great fast and easy In the  past I have had to run to the grocery store and purchased cards for more that what I was going to spend on a gift No 10 dollar coffee shop cards They only come in 25 or three 10 dollar cards
__label__Positive	The gift card was emailed right when I ask for it to be emailed

__label__Positive	The fastest and easiest why to send some one a gift card I would recommend this to anyone Two more words
__label__Neutral	Meh
__label__Positive	This card came in the box it shows and honestly looks BETTER than the picture It was very gorgeous and well put together and I cant wait to give it to my mother for her birthday This is a GREAT gift and it also is gorgeous The card goes well with the packaging I just wished you could change the bow color
__label__Negative	do not buy a gift card from amazon if there is any issue with it then email is the only way to resolve it amazon does not have a phone number for the gift card department
__label__Negative	I thought I sent a gift card to my sonin law and it did not come through on Christmas so I gave him money  if you charged this to me you need to check and see if it was ever sent  it was susposed to arrive on Christmas morning
__label__Positive	Boxed gift cards are a bit more difficult to use than the emailed version but nice designs and packaging make them seem more substantial
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	So easy to purchase and so tastefully done Thankyou Amazon
__label__Positive	love logans and email came fast
__label__Positive	These are the quickest easiest give ever
__label__Positive	Its great to save money every time you eat
__label__Positive	This was a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it  She does all her shopping through Amazon
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	a great gift solution
__label__Positive	I dont remember getting this
__label__Positive	Very pleased
__label__Positive	Originality and beauty
__label__Positive	What can I say Its an Amazon Gift Card
__label__Positive	Decided to gift my 10 year old grandson thinking hed just buy a video game  he bought a couple of BOOKS Very satisfied and I think this is going on my gift list from now on
__label__Positive	Amazon gifts cards are always well received gifts Nicely packaged
__label__Positive	This is a great way to instantly get a gift card to someone especially for those of us who leave things to the last minute Highly convenient when gifting somone who lives a long way from you including other countries and the recipient can choose their own gift from the huge range on Amazon Will definitely use again
__label__Positive	Grand daughter loves to read and will be purchasing novels with this card
__label__Positive	I purchase them for my granddaughter Its great   They help her get great healthy food   She loves them
__label__Positive	My friend loved it and she received the card immediately because l emailed it to her and l hope she buys something that she really wants with it
__label__Positive	The best coffee
__label__Positive	Great item fast shipping too
__label__Positive	Always a good choice for those people who live on the other side of the world Saves shipping and you can be sure that what they buy with it is exactly what they want
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	This is the perfect gift for the boy who has no idea what he wants  Kindle books legos you name it he can buy it
__label__Positive	Met my expectations
__label__Positive	I have difficulty finding practical gifts for my son who lives about 2500 miles away On a visit to Oregon I learned that he likes to eat at Sharis The chain doesnt even exist out here in New Jersey  I found it on your website and Levi received the gift certificate within minutes Ill use this service again

Thanks

Tim
__label__Positive	Muy efectivo
__label__Positive	This was even easier than ordering directly from Sephora where I can only order 2 at a time and have to make another order for any more than that  My niece and my girls are ages 1437 and they all appreciate this card which allows them to shop for brands we cannot find in our small town
__label__Neutral	So you want me to review a printable gift card  Ok  I spent a total of 2 minutes looking for that perfect gift that says  Hey Im really too busy to pick out a real gift but too self conscious to just give you money  So instead heres the equivalent of money that can only be spent at one place

It was easy enough to purchase with lots of options for style and quantity  I chose a video game theme because thats what I might have considered buying had I put more effort into the gift  My ISP did an adequate job delivering the email with the link for printing the gift card itself  My printer was awesome at printing the single page that represents the product itself it spit that thing out in less than 10 seconds  I did get a small paper cut while folding the paper to make the card itself but the antibiotic ointment I used helped heal that right up  I will say my brother showed an appropriate amount of joy when he received the gift card so thats good  I can only assume that he was happy with his purchase using the gift card but if not I cant say I could blame that on the gift card if he wasnt happy  All in all Id call it a solid gift giving venture
__label__Positive	My brother likes to buy little things with these gift cards Its like giving online cash to someone They can pick what they really want to buy
__label__Positive	This gift card is exactly as advertised 50 to spend at Express Express has nice high quality clothing And if you shop the sales they have quite a few throughout the year you can get some really great deals
__label__Positive	Since my sister buys a lot of books from amazon This was a birthday gift to her and she loved it
__label__Positive	As a service that Amazon offers  and as I have many relatives and friends scattered all over the globe this service is excellent I have bought many and never had a problem
__label__Positive	I really liked the choice of gift cards available at Amazon  I was puzzling for weeks what to buy a family member for their birthday when I suddenly remembered the Kindle wed bought her for Christmas  Problem solved  And I know the recipient was really pleased with the gift card and would make good use of the present
__label__Positive	Its a 2500 gift card Its all it is advertised to be
__label__Positive	Cute way to deliver a present
__label__Positive	What can I say its a gift card and the recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	Super cute
__label__Positive	nicely packaged made a very pretty gift
__label__Positive	Christmas Gift
__label__Negative	You are not describing which gift card you are asking about  Is it a card I gave or didnt receive  I just dont know for sure what you are asking me about
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Great and easy to use
__label__Positive	This was a perfect gift for my niece that was out of state whose birthday was in two days  I got her present to her early and she enjoyed opening the funny card over and over
__label__Positive	goood
__label__Positive	So easy My son used it to by games So much much easier than a credit card I Wish theyd let u use this and take the credit card off completely
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly
__label__Positive	Buy with confidence as there was no issues redeeming this gift card on the app  After that I was able to go to my local theater and see the romantic shoot em up comedy of the year Deadpool  It helps that I caught the gift card on a daily deal as well
__label__Positive	This is working well for me in place of going to a store and picking out a Christmas card and gift card to send After considering it I like that the card is sent to me with an envelope to send it on instead of directly to the person I will be sending it to It gives me a chance to sign the card or add a personal message
It arrived on time and in good condition so I ordered more
__label__Positive	My cousins birthday and I ran out of options and also time
I tried gifting this and it is an instant hit He loved it as he can shop whatever he want
__label__Positive	Great gift and service too 
__label__Positive	Bought this for a friend of mine who is into computers phones and other media  Delivered via email with no hassles  Cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	let them get what THEY want
__label__Negative	TOOK TOO LONG TO GET THERE EVEN UNITED STATES PARCEL SERVICES COULD HAVE DONE BETTER JOB ANY QUESTIONS  THE FACT THAT I HAD TO PAY TWENTY FIVE CENTS TO SEND THIS E CARD BOTHERS ME
__label__Positive	Arrived so quickly the recipient wasnt even up yet  It was a great way for him to start his birthday
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Positive	Always handy for my favorite grocery store and pharmacy
__label__Negative	If you need this item right away do not order it
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	easy thoughtful gift giving
__label__Negative	Do not buy it you are Australian  want to use it for your Kindle Only allows purchases from Amazon US store which Aussie kindle users can no longer purchase books from Very disappointed and only learned this after the purchase
__label__Positive	So convenient I love both the ease in ordering and the large selection offered by Amazon  This is a good gift allowing flexibility for purchasing for the recipient
__label__Positive	very nice and fast shipping
thanks
__label__Positive	I bough a ton for all the graduation parties
__label__Positive	Card worked perfectly
__label__Positive	This was a wonderful way to send a gift to someone  and it is perfect if it is being sent last minute
__label__Positive	Love to pay 40 for 50
__label__Positive	Cute way to present gift cards
__label__Positive	Easy to order and if you are prepared to print it off on slightly heavier stock its a ready made card This is the perfect gift for those whom you previously purchased books for  It takes the headache of hoping they havent already read the book as they get to select what they want  People say its the lazy option I said its the sensible more prudent options
__label__Positive	I chose this for a coworker who had a birthday on the weedend  I wanted her to get her gift on her actual birthday
Since she has a Kindle it was easy to send her a birthday gift card for a book
__label__Positive	How can I go wrong with a Amazon gift card as a gift
__label__Positive	Card was sent to me within 2 mins of purchase I had no problems redeeming it in store
__label__Positive	i love gift card
__label__Positive	I love the fact that you can print the gift card right at home and the receiver only has to enter the code that is printed on the certificate I gave this as a secret Santa gift and that person absolutely loved it

Great job
__label__Positive	Exactly what we wanted and ordered Shipping time was excellent The best
__label__Positive	It was a good opportunity to deliver a gift with our company name  It was easy and fast delivering by email
__label__Positive	The boss loved the gift and the presentation of the gift card
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with Amazons gift cards  The box it came in is a nice little tin that can be used for other things as well
__label__Positive	Its a digital code so not much to say other than to say that one should be causious when sending multiple codes to the same email address on the same day
__label__Positive	Gift card came on time and in an awesome box
__label__Positive	He buy like it
__label__Positive	They worked great
__label__Positive	This Gold Reveal is very sophisticated looking I especially like the black satin bow  an elegant touch
__label__Positive	I dont recall buying this
__label__Negative	Ordered 3 cards at the same time only 1 card arrived 2 days later and the other 2 cards have transportation problem and wont arrive till tomorrow night now I need to go to CVS to buy the back up cards
__label__Positive	I want to recommend this to others
__label__Positive	Wanted to send my college son a little something for Valentines Day and this was super easy and he received it on his email and was happywho doesnt like an Amazon gift card

__label__Positive	best idea ever what a way to start the day
__label__Positive	Very interesting reading about the Royal Arch and its history Very well written Freemasons and the general public can learn much about the Royal Arch
__label__Positive	The card is beautiful excellent gift
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are the gift everyone likes to receive and they are so easy to send to friends and Family
__label__Positive	The colors were a bit weak but the receiver was quite happy This might have been my printer but dont think so
__label__Positive	So convenient and quick when you realize 15 minutes before school you forgot to buy something
__label__Neutral	Its very nice but it arrived too late for me to gift it so I kept the tin to keep for next year and used the gift card on myself  Its cute  It was promised to arrive prior to Christmas and I ordered it via Amazon prime at least a week in advance  It only arrived today five days too late  Oh well
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	The gift card promptly came to my email  Printed it with no problems and now safely inside the grandsons stocking Thanks
__label__Positive	very happy to have received the gift card is an excellent service and has served me a lot to buy the things I had always wanted to buy
__label__Negative	Ridiculous  can only be used for spotify premium  not in the product  description  I have a spotify family premium account  when is a gift card not a gift card  when you cannot use it to pay for your monthly subscription
__label__Positive	Great Christmas gift card immediate delivery
__label__Positive	I loved it
__label__Positive	Great to use
__label__Positive	Very convenient and easy to purchase  A great last minute gift idea  I have given these out to a couple of my coworkers and they have worked really well  Would definitely buy again
__label__Positive	It was so easy to upload the photo and print out the gift card
__label__Positive	Im sure there is some way to personalize this gift with a note but I couldnt figure it out The recipient had to ask who it was from
__label__Positive	Card arrived as promised  Recipient extremely pleased  Expectations greatly exceeded
__label__Positive	The best gift is a gift the receiver chooses
__label__Positive	It was so nice and convenient to be able to shop fromhome and I got really good prices on all the items I was searching for I am definitely hooked on shopping on Amazon
__label__Positive	The recipient was pleased

__label__Negative	There was no money loaded onto the card Amazon has been amazing and after talking to them are issuing me a refund But beware We didnt know there was nothing on it until after we had eaten our dinners Would have been really embarrassing if we had given as a gift
__label__Positive	this has been the perfect gift as all of my boys love amazon and it carries so much different products that makes it so easy for them to get whatever they want or need

__label__Positive	Got this as a Christmas gift and it was great to be able to pick out what I wanted myself Highly recommended for a picky person
__label__Positive	Good deal
__label__Positive	I have been saying for a few years now that it would be great if you could buy Gift Cards online someone finally did it Its so nice to have that convenience with gas prices as high as they are Not only that in this busy world people dont always have the time to Go somewhere to purchase a gift or gift card so they give cash instead Retailers are losing that business because of that this way you still get the sale and Im a happy customer isnt that what its all about Im hoping more and more stores do this especially with the Christmas season coming Thank you Amazon for offering this

__label__Positive	This is probably the most amazing printable gift card I have ever given  I couldnt believe the way the colors in the word thank you popped  The code that was generated for the card recipient was amazing  I felt like I was giving the recipient his dreams as long as they cost 25 or less  I cannot even begin to count the hours I have spent thinking about the wordsmithing on the inside  It read like Shakespearean verse literally  I would have to say without any reservation that this gift card truly is the finest printable Amazon gift card EVER

PS  I am secretly hoping that when I go to order one again in the future that those crazy Amazon printable gift card designers outdo themselves with something so epic that I weep  Of course I cant even begin to imagine what that would be like  DreamsComeTrue

Frankly Im not trusting Amazon enough to order anything unless I am in my own home ever again

__label__Positive	A real convenient and easy way to send gifts
__label__Positive	It worked
__label__Negative	Ordered 4 cards Dec 17 2014 with 1 day shipping for my four grandchildren visiting Dec 20  3 cards arrived Dec 19 2014 mid afternoon when my mail is normally delivered  Since the kids were to be there early on the 20th for a short visit I knew the fourth card would not arrive on time for one of the kids  I did a chat and email with amazon with some rude and uncaring response  In the end an email of apology was sent indicating I would have my account credited  It did not say the card which was now in the mail to the grandson who did not get it that morning was canceled  Needless to say this led to some embarrassment to my wife and I but I simply gave him cash when I next saw him and he was happy enough and understanding  The issue is if you are going to cancel out the value of a card make it very clear to a customer before you do it  Amazon has my payment info on file so to handle it the way they did really stinks  The irony is I have read many reviews where customers who never received their cards had trouble getting a refund so I was blindsided by having it canceled for complaining it was late
__label__Negative	Item was canceled
__label__Negative	I didnt even receive the gift card  I am working on getting a refund now but it is quite the process
__label__Negative	Card came on time but was completely blank inside  No message or sender information in card so recipient did not know who it was from  A big disappointment in my eyes
__label__Positive	Bought this because amazon gave a bonus 10 Delivered instantly
__label__Positive	Its a gift card soooo
__label__Positive	An excellent way to give gifts to people who like to read
__label__Positive	Nice gift card
__label__Positive	got this for my neice and she will be using this for her own purchasesmakes it easy for me and she gets what she wants
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	Card didnt work Need my refund
__label__Positive	Perfect 
__label__Positive	Over the years weve managed to get Amazon gift cards at the top of our givers lists What can we possibly want that Amazon doesnt have
Size color cost All easily managed Do prefer the Ecards but as long as its Amazon we are happy
__label__Positive	very pretty
__label__Positive	I do not understand why theres bad reviews on this I ordered the Yankee Candle gift card email delivery and I received my code within 10 seconds I bought a few items on sale and it worked perfectly
__label__Positive	No problem with delivery
__label__Positive	null is amazing  and at fifty dollars null is a great app for kindle fire how did i ever get along without null
__label__Positive	Love gift cards
__label__Positive	My Grandfather loved receiving this for his Birthday
__label__Positive	These are only the best gift ever I mean who doesnt want one It was a hot item for Dirty Santa at Christmas
__label__Positive	It was all good
__label__Positive	much helped to send the gift to my brother who lives far from where I live
__label__Positive	AAAAAAA
__label__Positive	Cool
__label__Positive	Such a quick and convenient way to buy a gift card and print  it No waiting no lines
__label__Positive	When I dedicated my book Margarets Christmas Cookies to a friend who had been supportive of my writing efforts I took her a thankyou card and the printed gift card In that way she could order her own copy of my newly published ebook as my gift to her

The gift card was convenient to order and print and I was impressed with the clear instructions for its use printed right on the card itself

I plan to use this type of gift for my needs in the future

Thank you
__label__Positive	Nephew loved it
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Thanks  It was easy and fast  Great answer for a last minute gift
__label__Positive	Its a gift card what more can I say
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Money
__label__Positive	Very cool box it comes in
__label__Positive	I purchased this email gift card for my granddaughter It was easy to purchase and redeem She loves being able to get ebooks for her Kindle
__label__Positive	loved the container
__label__Positive	My sister loved it
__label__Positive	Very Easily done Im Pleased
__label__Positive	Excellent Love the Yankee candles and with the semi annual sale going on I saved 70 on my order Entered the gift card code and pin and was credited 25 Received gift code and pin about 3 minutes after order went thru Excellent all the way around
__label__Positive	Looked very nice Needed no wrapping
__label__Negative	Most Pathetic and worst item to pick for I ordered this card for wedding of one of my friends After two days the card is not delivered but status been shown as sent from day 1 I have to keep on asking my friend about this again n again as to check if he received the card or not That made it horrible

From customer support they just could not do anything technically and have no insight into what happened they just applied the gift card to his amazon account by email id and said we fixed ithaha They dont have any idea what a gift and greeting means Worst customer support experience too For them everything is transactional

Run away from this as this product has similar kind of reviews from others too Run away from this product as you are on your own and regret missing on the occasion and timing of sending this the very reason to order by this medium
__label__Positive	Mine came in good condition unlike some of the other reviews I ended up ordering another one
__label__Positive	a simple choice
__label__Positive	It was purrrrfect for a cat lover
__label__Positive	If I want to purchase something as in a preordered movie I can throw the exact cost up in a gift card to myself so that when its time for that move to be charged I dont have to worry about accounting for it from my bank account  Very convenient
__label__Negative	Really disappointed to find that the gift card reached the recipient without the message My niece had no idea who had sent the gift either
__label__Positive	These look great AND arrived overnight just as promised
__label__Positive	My grandchildren had the gift card money spent  in 15 minutes
__label__Positive	THis is the possible gift for a young person who owns a Kindle Yes they will download a few games but you will be surprised how many books find their way into their Kindle if they are encouraged
__label__Positive	Easy to buy
Easy to use
My son said he had no problem using it online when he bought something
He even asked for another email gift card
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Negative	I tried to order the gift card in the gift box Only problem was the check out procedure would not accept my daughters valid address I reentered everything at least 6 times and of course there is no phone number or any other easy way to contact a real person for help Extremely aggravating You need to fix this Amazon
__label__Positive	Just what I needed when I needed it So easy and was well received  I trusted that the process would work out deftly and it did
__label__Positive	Gift card
__label__Positive	A
__label__Positive	I gave this to my husband to choose his own ebooks for his new kindle Just like a book voucher

__label__Positive	No problems  Worked great  Arrived on time  Would buy again

__label__Positive	Great value and I love it If this comes again I will buy again
__label__Positive	Exactly what we were looking for
__label__Positive	All of these cards are wonderful  They are for my grandchildren for Christmas

__label__Positive	My sons girlfriend had a birthday recently and I didnt know what to get for her  I got her an inexpensive tablet for Christmas so I thought this was a good idea  She loved it  She never buys herself anything because she has a lot of student loan debt she is trying to pay off

__label__Positive	My parents loved it

I purchased the gift card and chose the option to send it to him in an email and I received the email within minutes It was quick and easy and great if youre a last minute shopper They also had a lot of card options if youre picky about that Over all a great gift for people that are hard to shop for
__label__Positive	Love the case

__label__Positive	Gift cards the perfect gift
__label__Positive	The recipient  a teen  loved it
Arrived quickly and I have no doubt will be used immediately
Its nice to have the gift card option so they can get exactly what they want
__label__Negative	I decided to send my 12 year old niece a gift card for her birthday  I sent it to my dads email first since I couldnt remember hers and it was rejected  twice So I got hers and resent it  not sent I contacted customer service and Dana resent it and guaranteed it went through I contacted my niece  nothing Back to online chat and then come to find out the RECIPIENT needs an account with Amazon to get a card in their email  that it will not go through if there is no account associated with the card  I ended up after about two hours of this back and forth not to mention I was asked to ask my niece to check various inboxes etc cancelling the card I went back and looked nowhere does it mention that the person getting the card also needs an account So my niece gets nothing from me I get to feel terrible I missed her birthday And I love when they ask if they can help you with anything else Nope I think youve done enough thank you
__label__Positive	I was very skeptical about purchasing this egift card after reading the reviews I was worried that there would be no balance on the card after purchase However I ended up very pleased with the transaction and there were no issues whatsoever Very simple and convenient
__label__Positive	He loved it
__label__Positive	How easy and how quick the recipients received their gifts
__label__Positive	Grest
__label__Positive	Gift cards can be considered an easy out option but being able to personalize it with a special picture gives it that little extra touch
__label__Positive	Great way to give lastminute gifts
__label__Positive	Gift card was just as shownnice presentation boxtoo Nice to be able to purchase online so didnt have to find the right amount in a store
__label__Negative	Was also given 3 pack for Christmas present went to Harkins theatre to use was told no go on line and pay the fee to use the gift WHAT A RIPOFF
__label__Positive	Love this gift tin choice very cute and reusable
__label__Positive	Again how can you go wrong with an Amazon Gift Card especially when it comes prewrapped in such a cute little box  This was a hit with the kids we had no idea what to buy for this year and even our community giving tree
__label__Positive	Sweet message

__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Great way to convert those stupid rebate debit cards you receive after purchasing certain products
__label__Positive	So convenient
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	Great gift idea and a good way to give happiness to a great friend in need or an enemy if they are lactose intolerant
__label__Negative	it didnt work
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Negative	The absolute WORST gift you could ever give anyone  Their business model is to TAKE your 25 for the gift card and then make you jump over as many hurdles as possible to get your movie tickets  They say FIRST Lets make the website as convoluted as possible so all the non techie Little Old Ladies give up trying to redeem their 25  My 65 year old mother and many of her girlfriends ALL got fandango gift cards but they just sat around unused because they didnt know how to use them

Next if you ARE able to navigate their website and give them the appropriate Code Numbers on the card which youll probably spend 30 minutes wondering why they keep telling you your entering an Invalid Code you can purchase your movie tickets  BUT for EACH TICKET you purchase they charge you an UNAVOIDABLE 125 Convenience Fee  So if you purchase 4 tickets you are going to pay an additional 5 DOLLARS convenience fee  So your 25 Gift card is only worth 20

Then you say this must be some sort of a SICK JOKE because this is the most INCONVENIENT way to buy movie tickets  Do not believe ANY positive review on these gift cards they are ALL PHONEY  There is no human in their right mind who would actually LIKE fandango gift cards  Please please please if you HAVE to give someone a gift card  make it a gift card to AMC or to a Restaurant where you can simply walk in and hand them the gift card to use it
__label__Positive	This card is Freedom with plastic I have been able to purchase some wish list books without guilt about groceries  Thanks amazon and thanks Husband
__label__Positive	its the perfect gift for our out of state son  easy to purchase and it allows him to get what he wants so much to choose from on amazon and it was delivered right to his email on the day I wanted it to be how great is that
__label__Positive	Always a pleasure to get a gift card  Its versatile and can be used for any Amazon purchase including the marketplace  So easy to load to my balance and use
__label__Positive	Good and easy
__label__Positive	You make an easy way to send a gift
__label__Positive	Very nice presentation
__label__Positive	Great packaging  fun to open
__label__Positive	Ab Fab  So much fun
Wonderful idea to give that extra kick to a gift card box  They know its a gift card but they do not expect that great pop up inside  It is just an extra treat to open this magical little box
__label__Positive	I love the way Amazon Gift Cards work You can use them anytime and still have some left Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Fun and easy way to give a gift to someone in another city or state Loved the card options 
__label__Negative	This came to me with a zero balance I contacted amazon numerous times They know who used this card where the items went and email address associated with the theft of this card and they have done nothing I am out 50000 and Amazon blew me off and told me oh well
__label__Positive	This is the cutest gift card for Amazon fanatics  It comes in a little Amazon box  The recipient thought it was hilarious
__label__Positive	Arrived fast and I was able to use toward my trip on the website  It would not work from the mobile view you have to be in the full website mode if youre doing it from a cell phone

__label__Neutral	its a gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift for the one that you dont know what else to buy for Christmas
__label__Neutral	I love Amazon and the gift card idea is a wonderful one  What I dont love is the tiny print that says your gift card may not be delivered right away  Unfortunately because my gift was for a birthday the recipient did not receive it until after his day was over  I wish that fact was made clearer
__label__Positive	My niece will love it
__label__Positive	Better than guessing all the time And you can repay a favor

__label__Positive	Some people appreciate a gift and are grateful someone thought of them much less spent money on em Then theres people who are too difficult to purchase forgift cards are especially made for these types Or if you dont really know a person and just need a quick gift thats says enjoy your special day Basically bottom line is I thought of youheres a gift card This is a good thing and Im pleased w purchase

__label__Negative	If I could give it a 1 I would  Paid my 25 dollars sent card as a gift and the money was never loaded on the card  Now I have to go to Mars and back to take care of it  I will never buy a gift card online through Amazon again
__label__Neutral	I thought the small box it came in was really cool This card was a gift but the little box was too crushed to give Its like having a wedding ring in a crushed ring case when proposing though obviously much less serious Ha

The card was great and I even used a deal to get 10 off But the little box was smashed Other than that theres really nothing to review with a gift card It was easy to redeem on Amazon and most people will always appreciate an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	good

__label__Positive	Ez to purchase
__label__Positive	This was a perfect gift for a teenager
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card is a perfect gift idea Amazon offers such a wide variety of products that the gift card gives you flexibility to choose what you want most The ease of use entering card information and Amazon storing that in my account was very simple and fast
__label__Neutral	Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the person receiving this card has to drive over 30 miles to a theater so it was a good thing he read the tiny tiny print telling him to purchase on line before he left home I feel bad they are only good for tickets and not snacks plus there is a charge for using the card will think twice before I purchase gift again
__label__Positive	Looks great
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Easy to customize for our lovely customers
__label__Positive	What is not to love about Amazon gift cards Keep them on hand for quick gifts or thankyous

__label__Positive	Gift cards are always a good gift
__label__Positive	Perfect gift and so easy to print I love that ibwas able to personalize
__label__Positive	What can you really say this is an electronic gift card that you can email to someone I liked the choice in stylesthemes that they had and it was easy enough to purchase

Im not sure if this is typical but it did take nearly an hour for my mom to receive her gift card via email while the books that I bought and emailed her as a gift went through right away Not a deal breaker for me but I figured someone would find that information useful
__label__Positive	Just what i excepted
__label__Positive	Great easy to send gift
__label__Positive	Wonderfully easy I have to send gifts overseas and this is the best way
__label__Positive	is good

__label__Positive	Definitely worth the money if youre spending the money on amazon
__label__Positive	Gave as Christmas presents
__label__Negative	TERRIBLE idea not to list price
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an Amazon Gift Card I bought it for a friend who is a former librarian and a total book freak
__label__Positive	Amazon bailed me out of a shortterm obligation Thank you
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Great idea
__label__Positive	Perfect for my Mom and she loved the card  Just wish they had an actual picture on the gift card itself instead of just the Amazon logo
__label__Positive	Loved them  Love the easy access to purchasing them and the super fast delivery  The come already to use LOVE IT
__label__Positive	love itunes especially at a discount
__label__Positive	I love using the Amazon Gift Cards Not only are they delivered immediately but Amazon keeps the records for you In one case one of my gift cards had yet to be redeemed I knew this by checking my account A quick email to my recipient took care of this problem Amazon keeps a calendar record sending you a reminder a year later on this purchase as well The process of buying throiugh Amazon could not be easier
__label__Positive	gave as a gift nice impression
__label__Negative	Gift card was cancelled before used honestly Amazon didnt want to do the foot work involved in correcting the problem I had to get in touch with petco who in turn made Amazon do there job
__label__Positive	goob
__label__Positive	Received gift card right away Thank you Amazon
__label__Positive	Very smooth transaction
__label__Positive	the perfect gift
__label__Negative	Do not every buy this card I bought a card for 2000 and used it one time for a 489 order then the next time it said it had a 00000 balance  They want you to download there app which was a pain in the but to do and use
__label__Neutral	When I ordered this item along with the other 25 gift card the Amazon site advertised 2 for 40  Or Buy 2 get 10 back I think
Yet I was charged full price for both the 25 cards Not as promised
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	The gift cards are easy to use I love that you can order them and the container comes with it for free I enjoy Amazon and make MANY purchases Why wouldnt you want this stuff delivered to your doorstep for virtually the same price many times much less Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Didnt come as fast as it said because it got sent to wrong carrier facility somehow but still came before I was needing it and I was informed of the mix up without having to call Product looks great and you can reuse the snowflake tin over and over The snowflake tin is actually awesome and not cheap looking Im shocked it was free
__label__Positive	These were a big hit with my teen granddaughters
__label__Negative	It took over an hour to redeem the card To verify the card you have to do a series of checking boxes of a picture that contain a certain object You have to do several of these and if you miss one you have to start all over The pictures were very confusing and cluttered I bought a gift card from them before and it wasnt like that I hope they go back to the old way
__label__Positive	I had no issues with the e gift card  Within 5 minutes of ordering the gift card it was in my email I was able to use it to place a online order with no problem at all Very happy i decided to get it
__label__Positive	My nephew enjoyed it
__label__Positive	My son enjoyed his card

__label__Positive	Beautiful package
__label__Positive	Quick and simple
__label__Neutral	I thought there would be thoughts on how to make adjustments using the Greeks  Has some value but did not tell me anything I didnt know
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	What do you do when your husband casually mentions at 4 pm on Christmas Eve that hed really like to have the 100year Anniversary hat for Wrigley Field  You do what I did and slip away to the computer and get him an Amazon gift card  That way he can get his hat and whatever else he might decide he likes  Perfect for lastminute gifts  thanks Amazon

__label__Positive	This is the  most thoughtful and yet easily accomplished grad gift ever The recipient can buy necessities or not as their needs or wants dictate while those of us a generation or so removed can feel confident  that our gift is useful and appreciated

__label__Negative	This came for my sons birthday and was not activated  I am upset and horrified and I dont know how you would allow this to happen  It was a birthday gift and that makes it worse and he didnt even get the gift since they wouldnt honor it
__label__Positive	Everyone likes tacos It came when it was supposed to The balance was correct It was ready to use and The Meal was delicious
__label__Positive	bueno
__label__Positive	Great idea for people who were impossible to buy for It makes a great surprise gift and I love that it has no expiry date on redemption
__label__Positive	The process was easy and seamless What more can one expect Plus since the recipient owns a Kindle it provides excellent flexibility

__label__Positive	Very efficient and easy
__label__Positive	Easiest gift I ever purchased Cant go wrong with a gift card

Easy to buy and was given info pretty quick
__label__Positive	This was great  I was able to order it and the person received it right away  No shipping or wrapping on my part  Just what a book worm needed
__label__Positive	While I couldnt be there to help with our new twin grandsons
the gift card made it so we could help in a practical way right now
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with gift cards
__label__Positive	Great idea Nicely packaged We loved it
__label__Positive	Cute and convenient
__label__Positive	Everything was superb Amazon even notified me when the card was seenand then when it was used by the recipient Both useful ways of letting me know my card isnt just sitting in limbo Only thing I would have liked that isnt a feature yet is the ability to see my final photocustomised card in full size Otherwise excellent really theres nothing to complain about 55 definitely Will use again
__label__Positive	It was wonderful my Grand Daughter really liked it
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a gift card
__label__Negative	Eh
__label__Positive	Quick email delivery Had no problem using the code
__label__Positive	Great and easy gift for family who lives far away
__label__Neutral	works on short notice
__label__Positive	Awesome product for a good priceWill order again
__label__Positive	i like the convenience of the print method but i think it needs more images and designs in relation with books or kindle
__label__Positive	Very userfriendly egift card process  Only think I would like improved is a printable order receipt at the end of the purchase instead of having it emailed to us  Its probably just our situation but with the receipt sent to our gmail account we cant print a full receipt for our order due to the nature of the page display
__label__Positive	I like your gift card They are just gift cards for my personal account  I will continue to purchase Thanks
__label__Positive	Great gift for distant relative
__label__Positive	great easter gifts for the kids Easy to buy and they buy what they want they also enjoy their amazon shopping experience

__label__Negative	The personalized  Christmas message was not printed on the card  It was printed on the invoice but I do not include invoices with Christmas gifts
__label__Positive	These cards have turned out to be great gifts for our preteen grandchildren who live some distance from us This card and previous ones have turned our grandchildren into avid readers  The unexpected value  our smiles when we receive copies of their Honor Role certificates certificates that arrive on a regular basis  Well worth the money spent
__label__Positive	Best gift idea suitable for anyone  Easy to shop for  Unfortunately the one we mailed to friends out of state never reached them  Apparently stolen in the mail  Beware
__label__Positive	My sister has a Kindle and loves buying new books  Perfect gift for her or anyone She loved the gift card
__label__Positive	Very cute durable case that comes free with the gift card
__label__Positive	This Subway card arrived in the mail and I was surprised to see just one card  I thought I was getting 5 500 cards  Its ok as Im keeping the card for myself  I got online and registered the card and had no trouble using it that same day
__label__Positive	Love Lane Bryant they always have great sales
__label__Positive	Easy to redeem Hassle free

__label__Positive	I mean its a gift card
__label__Positive	Everyone always loves Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	I found that Amazon Gift Cards are good gift choices for any occasion and for Christmas the Nativity Scene designed greeting card was a good choice to emphasize the reason for the season
__label__Positive	As exciting as a gift card can be the little Amazon box really makes getting one of these more fun This is a simple yet creative way to give a gift The words oh cute will be heard many times
__label__Positive	This is a wonderful and easy way to send a gift without having to go to the post office The animated gift cards are fun and unique
__label__Positive	AWESOME
__label__Positive	Wonderful
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are always a pleasure to receive
__label__Positive	This so convenient  If I cant think of a gift for people I care about this is always a great gift I dont know anyone that doesnt love a gift card from Amazon
__label__Positive	Very nice
__label__Positive	Just as Described
__label__Positive	what a great gift for anyone regardless of age you can find anything and know that your shopping on a great site
__label__Positive	great gift idealoved the box
__label__Positive	great gift idea for an anniversary
__label__Positive	Its an easy way to send gifts to friends and family oversees And if you are an author like me you can create your own card with the front cover of your book inserted there That means that your friend can only redeem the gift card for your book or the stipulated product that youve purchased on their behalf This is an excellent service and wellworth considering
__label__Positive	Great gift for a new mom when you dont know exactly what she needed To be able to send on line was a plus

__label__Positive	its awesome
__label__Positive	Our soninlaw loved this as a giftfor a guy who knows what he wants off amazonbut we dontso gift card was perfect
__label__Positive	Got this during lightning deal Good savings
__label__Positive	This was perfect for my brother He is hard to buy for but loves to shop at Amazon I ordered the card and it was delivered the next day The little gift box was much more festive than just an email It doesnt get any easier than this
__label__Positive	The amazoncom gift card is a wonderful gift because amazoncom has such a large variety of items to choose from and using the card as a payment source is a fast and easy way to shop  Im going in now to purchase one for my Mother for her upcoming birthday  She shops the site a lot also 
__label__Positive	Just as described
__label__Positive	Best way to get travel to people who would refuse money
__label__Negative	My granddaughter states that she did not receive it  How do you think I feel about it  I paid hard earned money for a gift card that was never delivered and apparently I dont have any recourse  Still waiting for resolution to this issue
__label__Positive	I did not see the product since it went directly to the third party I indicated  However I do know that buying and paying and receiving it was simple which was much appreciated  The recipient was of course very pleased
__label__Positive	This is a great thing You can send it to email in minutes No more worry about Birthday gifts
__label__Positive	40 on a 50 gift card Quick delivery no complaints
__label__Positive	Easy fast and dependable

__label__Positive	Cute
__label__Positive	Great Deal I love FireHouse subs If youre trying them for the first time try the Hook and Ladderabsolutely delicious  
__label__Positive	The egift card gave the recipient the freedom to choose her gift and because the recipient was in the process of moving to another state I didnt have to worry about  the new physical address or worry about timely delivery via snail mail 
__label__Positive	Its a gift card Its made from plastic looks just like the ones you can find anywhere and spends just like cash at Lowes Dont know what else to say The reason Amazon sets limits on quantity is due to fraud and security reasons thats standard for gift card purchases and no you typically cannot use gift cards to buy other gift cards
__label__Positive	FINE
__label__Positive	Living far away from family makes shopping difficult as one is not in touch with everyday needs This is a gift that was requested
__label__Positive	A great gift for stress free holidays
__label__Positive	forgot to give it to person
__label__Positive	I loved the cards they matched the gift cards they were great and a big hit to the recipient Thanks
__label__Positive	Once I figured out how to print it it has turned out to be great and it registers remaining balance everytime I use it  Exc job
__label__Positive	A
__label__Positive	gave some through email and some mailed to me in boxes and with 10 gift back this was an easy gift to give for Christmas
__label__Positive	My 8 year old grandson was thrilled to receive this gift card  He has plans for it already
__label__Positive	EXCELENTE
__label__Positive	Card was emailed in few minutes
__label__Positive	Perfect answer for a belated gift  The card arrived in its own box making it look extra special
__label__Positive	Prompt and easy
__label__Positive	Love the tin for easy gift giving
__label__Positive	Great gift but I found out after I purchased this that if you buy the same 2500 gift card directly from Subway you get an additional 6 inch sub
__label__Positive	Surely the guests will enjoy this party favor  Perfect in the box with the ribbon it came with or with your own special wrap
__label__Positive	My greatgranddaughter wants everything and since she lives in Maryland I have no idea what toys she already has  The gift certificate was a hit so she and her mother can have a lot to choose from at Amazon
__label__Positive	Presented to others easily
__label__Positive	This process could not have been easier or more convenient Thank you so much for offering such a great service
__label__Positive	it was appreciated and arrived in minutes
__label__Positive	Great nice gift
__label__Positive	Very nice gift card packaging
__label__Positive	Worked like a charm
__label__Negative	Thank you
__label__Positive	The easiest things for a quick gift I use them religiously
__label__Positive	We sent our daughter in law a 50 gift card for Mothers Day and we wanted it to get there that day and was out of state  It got there in a matter of minutes so we were very pleased and so was she
__label__Positive	My son was happy to receive this Quick delivery Thank you
__label__Positive	GREAT GIFT
__label__Positive	Used it on vacation No problems Great
__label__Positive	I was insecure using it at first and made a mistake  The wonderful and immediate  service I received reassured me and  I would use it again for gifts  Thank you DKC
__label__Positive	A nice last minute gift addition
__label__Positive	I like giving gift cards this way the person you are giving one too will get what they want and not have to pretent that they like you gift They  dont have to hide it or give it away Everone is always happy
__label__Positive	Beautiful card  and easily to access
__label__Positive	I love to give and receive gift cards  Great way to give the gift of books and the opportunity of choosing what the reciever wants
__label__Positive	Good product
__label__Negative	One gift card was delivered immediately  The other two were only delivered after one of the recipients and myself spent several days trying to get the other two delivered  It was a horrible experience but it should have been as quick and easy as the first
__label__Positive	We love this BBQ and order it often as a gift  families with newborns or families who have lost loved ones The gift card is an added bonus
__label__Positive	Just when you thought you had everything Amazon offers more products with this card than any other other store on the net  Buy one today
__label__Negative	I bought my 12 year old daughter a Kindle Fire as a gift  She could not download any Apps not even free Apps without a credit card  I purchased this gift card so that she could buy Apps  However that was not good enough  For some reason Amazon cant allow you to purchase Apps with a gift card without having a credit card on file  Since I am not turning over my credit card to a 12 year old I found this to be a poor process

Apple products allow you to download free Apps without a credit card  Also you can buy Itunes cards and make purchases  Not sure why Amazon can develop software that allows you to get free Apps without a credit card and that knows whether or not you have enough money ofn your gift card to make a purchase

I do like the ability to buy the card and print it out or Email it  But it didnt work out for me
__label__Positive	Ordered this gift card in promotion and was delivered instantly via email I was able to use the code immediately for purchase Amazon has flawless system in place
__label__Positive	Cute card
__label__Positive	Whats not to like
__label__Negative	Two 25 iTunes gift cards would not redeem  Was given to a child as a Christmas giftpretty disappointing  I have purchased many gift cards from Amazon and have never had this problem before  Must be a third party problem
__label__Positive	thanks
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	great deal
__label__Positive	Niece and nephew and my kids get several of these every xmas and birthday
__label__Positive	A procrastinators dream  Loved the email gift card option
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	My boss was feeling down on Valentines We all chipped in to get him an Amazon Gift Card His mood changed dramatically for the rest of the week  He was so happy Who would have figured
__label__Positive	Well received gift
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card is an easy way to show someone you care Especially a picky someone who would rather choose their own gift  Winwin
__label__Positive	Great product
__label__Positive	We were sure it was the right size and that it would not need to be returned or exchanged Gift giving made easy for our kids who live far away
__label__Positive	Got it for less than its worth
__label__Positive	There was no money loaded on this card purchased for a childs gift How embarrassing it was purchased 221 from Amazon I have all documentation Cannot get any response from anyone I am an excellent customer but if I dont hear anything back about this that will have to change
__label__Positive	E gift card was great Sent it by email and it arrived minutes later
__label__Positive	I love hoops and yoyo

__label__Positive	It was a gift The person got the card Theres not much more I can say about it How dso you get wordy About a gift card
__label__Positive	Good baked items
__label__Positive	What i love most about Amazon gift cards is that you can get them in almost any value amount This makes them perfect for consolidating what remains on those Gift Credit Cards This Xmas I found myself with 3 gift credit cards each with less than 2 on them What to do Buy amazon gift cards for myself then apply it to my Amazon purchase Nice
__label__Positive	perfect gift for any occasion  easy to get and give
__label__Positive	It was a great way to spend a hot summer day with my family We all walked around the Eastland Mall in Bloomington Illinois and then ate a nice healthy lunch Thanks
__label__Positive	Always a great gift and like the print at home option for procrastinators
__label__Negative	I purchased 50 worth of movie tickets as a Holliday gift  Sadly the emali with the gift was never received  I repeatedly went to my Amazon account and resent the gift and it was still never received  I tried over and over again to contact Amazon so that I could report my problem but
was never able to reach anyone as I could not find a way  Other than all that Im still a big fan of Amazon
__label__Positive	Perfect last min teacher gift
__label__Positive	Good restaurant

__label__Positive	Family think these are great gifts  Ill buy more next year at Christmas or maybe for birthdays
and the boxes are cute
__label__Positive	An easy way to give a nice surprise Works like a charm
__label__Positive	This was a little problematic but I eventually found out that I caused the problem by keying in the wrong email address for the
recipient  It was one of my sons older email address but was not rejected by the mail system  The correction facility to cancel the first one and send it again worked very well  I dont know if it would be possible for Amazon to pick up the email address from my contacts list
__label__Positive	She spent hours finding and contemplating its useonly bad thing is shes now a regular on Amazon and is prime
__label__Positive	Despite instructions on how to gift a book the Indian site did not permit it so I had to resort to purchasing a gift card and emailing a link to the book for them to purchase I would prefer to just got the book but the work around works
__label__Positive	This was bought for my grandkids Easter gift and they love it They all how there little accounts and like being able to buy what they want with their own money Great Gift for them
__label__Negative	Recently I purchased the gift card at 50 with the expectation to get 10 credit on amazons promotional offer  I made a few purchases of kindle ebooks after I got the promotion code  However I could not apply the promotion code on the orders electronic delivery
1 I have nowhere to seek help to find out whether the orders I wanted to place are qualified for promotional credit 2 Each time I placed order there was nowhere for me to input the promotion code to get the 10 credit and 3 Your amazon email informed me that the promotional offer would be expired sometime in October 2013 4 the generic online search for helps from amazon website would not solve the problem at all
Due to the problems of not getting the promotional offer I did not plan to buy the gift card even I enjoyed reading on Kindle I wish your customer support would help and explain to me to how to get my 10 credit  My phone number is 626 4173610  Thanks
__label__Positive	always a hit
__label__Positive	way to go to order online and ship to your door without having
to fight the crowds love to give gift cards kids love them

__label__Positive	Great way to send a gift Was very easy to purchase and send I was about to send a egift card from giftcertificatescom and was turned off by their almost 400 shipping and handling charge in addition to the card purchase amount for an E GIFT CARD I thought I had made a mistake and put a snailmail gift card in my cart but I double checked and it was correctly ordered online gift card to send to anothers email address I looked around and ultimately ended up purchasing from Amazoncom which had a 000 charge to send TY Amazon

__label__Positive	Delivered in minutes easy to receive and send
__label__Positive	Much appreciated gift
__label__Positive	I got this as a gift for someone Its a gift card so theres not a whole lot to say about it It worked And while you can pick up gift cards anywhere now a days its convenient getting them on Amazon along with earning 5x points using the Amazon card
__label__Positive	I gave this as a gift for the holidays  Best gift ever  The person I gave it to loved it and enjoyed the gift box  It was so much better than just emailing a gift certificate and the presentation added so much
__label__Negative	Dont buy the egift card through a third party ie Amazon I bought a 30 Sephora egift card for my sister and she went to use it and it claimed there was 0 dollars there Called Sephora they cant help me Called Amazon they cant help me 30 down the drain and a sister who things I ripped her off Oh better yet Amazon tried to convince me that I myself must have redeemed my sisters gift card BS

__label__Positive	I had my gift card electronically delivered and it made food shopping a breeze I didnt even need to print it out
__label__Neutral	I could not use 10 discount received in an email There should be a phone number available to people who have trouble contacting you via the internet I am not happy with amazoncom and am considering cancellation of membership to this site forever I feel your site can be frustrating when trying to resolve issues

Ernie Kohlstruk
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Neutral	Reviews of gift cards seem silly and being harassed to make them is annoying
__label__Positive	Good buy
__label__Positive	My grandson buys from Amazon all the time and this gift will make it easier for him since he does not have a credit card
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Negative	Bought 2 of these and headed out to my local GameStop assuming they would be in my inbox when I arrived

Nope

If you buy multiple gift cards at once they hold it for whatever reason and you cant cancel them Customer service was as helpful as a knife in a gun fight

Will not purchase gift cards over Amazon again unless my purchase is 25 dollars or less

__label__Positive	This is a nice gift card container and Amazon gift cards are a great present for any occasion  I love giving and receiving Amazon gift cards  They are the perfect gift
__label__Positive	Got it on a lightning deal Great deal
__label__Negative	It is my mistake   I mistook amazoncom to be the same as amazoncouk  not knowing that the former is America based and so my relative is unable to action the gift voucher for 15 english pounds because of the cost of postage
My Visa account was debited on the 13 February
I dont have any other details but would appreciate if you would transfer the gift voucher order to amazoncouk
There must be some relationship between the organisations
If that request is not possible please send the gift voucher to an American hospice cum hospital
Sincerely
Gillian Partridge
__label__Positive	great gift card

__label__Negative	Product was expected It arrived later than promised
__label__Positive	I ask for Amazon gift cards for all occasions  My sons live in other States and the ease of buying the perfect gift by email is wonderful  I am in two Book Clubs and have a Kindle so having some credit on my account makes reading more fun and no guilt for my budget  If I want or need anything other than books it works for that too  This is a most appreciated gift for anyone

__label__Positive	We go to Legal Seafood Restaurant in Warwick RI This is an incredible seafood restaurant On top of that try their Greek Salad with their dressing Its wonderful Dont for get their chowder for a tasty appetizer Getting the Legal Seafood gift card just makes it easier to go to a fine restaurant
__label__Negative	The product did not work at all for me or my husband  We tried it for a week and actually slept worse than before taking it
__label__Negative	I was given an older version gift card with no PIN number and I cannot physically place an online order for later pick up Panera Bread informed me that they cannot help since it is Amazon that provided an older version gift card
__label__Positive	Good and fast service However it would be nice to have one place to just enter an amount without having to search for the correct gift card to process it
__label__Positive	Great little free tins for last minute shopping or gifts
__label__Positive	I mean its a gift card 5 stars i guess cuz it worked and was valid But its not like you can really rate a gift card itself What it is for is irrelevant to a rating so Im not going to post my ideas on the resturant itself I ordered this card I got this card I used this card And it worked Thats that
__label__Positive	The Starbucks card was the best ever
__label__Positive	Arrived promptly  It was the restaurants gift card good service I will use again
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are always a hit  This one was especially cute as a graduation gift
__label__Positive	Arrived in time  Thanks
__label__Positive	For me there is nothing like Amazon Gift Cards Ive been so ill the past four years and dont know what I would do without Amazon
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Great gift couldnt be easier
__label__Positive	Fantastic Easy and fast
__label__Negative	The pop up gift box was defective
__label__Positive	this gift card was great for me to send via internet for my sister in Indonesia I got a greeting card and gift card in one Quick service
__label__Positive	great option as usual
__label__Positive	An Amazon gift card is a wonderful gift to give and to receive
__label__Positive	Great for gifts
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and just as expected
__label__Negative	It took over 30 minutes to even take the money off the gift card
__label__Positive	Got it for my granddaughter for Christmas She love it
__label__Negative	It went to junk mail and he didnt know about it 
__label__Positive	I mean seriously this needs to be reviewed You cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Really nice not to wrap it or find a box
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
Granddaughter like it a lot
__label__Positive	It is what it is and it is good Eleven more words required ummmm lol     
__label__Positive	Great gift cards they do not charge to activate them unlike other cards that charge a service fee for utilizing the card
__label__Positive	as expected
__label__Positive	I like the graphic on the thank you card  I appreciate the ease with which I was able to get the gift card
__label__Positive	Just love this gift card
__label__Positive	I love how Amazon offers gift boxes and cute gift holders  Dresses up a gift card and makes the gift seem even that much more
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	They came perfect and ready to use as gifts
__label__Negative	Bummed
__label__Positive	My nephew loved it
__label__Positive	Adorable cup cake tin The paper on the bottom is light blue Sprinkles are adorable Highly recommend Perfect for a birthday or could even be given for a boy baby shower
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	This was a very great gift as they can get what they want and the service was great thank you
__label__Positive	Timely arrival  Happy daughter
__label__Positive	I had problem at firstbut its working knowthanks
__label__Positive	BEST GIFT CHOICE EVER  Everyone pretty much knows the amount their budget allows for gifts  Gift registries are great sources of ideas but you still have to choose something have it mailed to you and then wrap it  Theres always something anyone can find at Amazon  Cant beat the convenience  Way to go for me anyway
__label__Negative	Gift cards should work  I sent gift cards to my neices for Christmas  They did not work  Their father asked Amazon to refund so I could quickly send egift cards rather than wait till January 3 or later for new cards to be issued  I have twice since spoken with an Amazon representative  The first time I was told a refund was being processed  The second time I was told that I could not speak to anyone in the department where my issue has been sent  January 9 and still no refund or contact from Amazon  How do I get this company to refund my money and communicate with me
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	GREAT
__label__Positive	I GOT THIS AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE  DONT KNOW HOW THEY LIKED GETTING IT BUT I HOPE THEY WERE HAPPY
__label__Positive	goodhahaha
__label__Positive	Ideal for sending a gift from overseas to a boy in the USA especially as my home currency is pounds sterling but the boy wants dollars to spend on his chosen gift
__label__Positive	It was great It did not deliver when I requested only issue
__label__Negative	div idvideoblockR1Q0YJ9I2F0HEZ classasection aspacingsmall aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name value classvideourlinput typehidden name value classvideoslateimgurlnbsp okay cool  I get that its a gift card But theres something sticky all over it And the paper is all bent  Luckily I didnt send it to the person receiving it as a gift
__label__Positive	An easy but thoughtful way to shop for my teen age grandson
__label__Positive	A great  way to get a gift
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Christmas present
__label__Positive	Worked well
__label__Positive	simple easy on point simply choose amount choose recipient designate time to send voila  this was the perfect gift for my husband
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	The tin was a hit and so was the gift card inside
__label__Negative	Just went to Einsteins and they would not take this gift card  Buyer Beware
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are always a good gift since one can buy most anything at a good price
__label__Positive	Item as described
__label__Negative	When I went to use this gift card there was no money on it
__label__Positive	A perfect card for my brothers 21st birthday that included an Amazon gift card to spend Fast and super easy to do
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Easy to send
__label__Positive	Grandson loved it
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	We are willing to feel free to available
__label__Positive	Teen Grandson loved it
__label__Positive	Yes my daughter was thrilled and eagerly spent it She really had to curtail her wants but was pleased with her choice Me too
__label__Positive	Slick  Easy to do  So convenient  Loved by everyone  Personalized with a photo made it even more appreciated
__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift card  I bought it for my husband so he can continue to buy books for his Kindle
__label__Positive	I love the cupcake gift card tin with the raised sprinkles It really makes the gift card seem like a gift and my friend is keeping it as a decoration Always super fast service great for last minute shoppers
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly as it was intended to
__label__Positive	Love the convenience
__label__Positive	Received quickly and worked great
__label__Positive	Tk you
__label__Positive	Was what I expected
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	I love the fact that I can buy a gift card and post it to someones Facebook page but each time that I have done this Ive had to repostresend it at least 2 times  This happened twice on the same day  I sent one to a nephew and one to my daughter and about 2 hours later checked their pages to see if it was there and it was not  I did get notifications that said it has been posted to your friends facebook but it was not there  Then I had to log back in to Amazon go through the motions and have it reposted  In one case I ended up just emailing it because it would never post  I dont know if its settings in FB or what the deal this particular gift card did post to her Facebook page after the 2nd attempt  My only bad thought on this is if I had not checked her page I might have never known for days and days that she didnt get it  It was her Birthday and I wanted it delivered to her ON her Birthday  So please  double check when you send one via Facebook that it DOES indeed get posted to their page  Thank You
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	People seem to enjoy being able to shop for what they want and amazon is so easy This was the perfect gift for an amazon junkie
__label__Positive	gift cards rule especially for us lazy people that dont have time to put into specialized gift shopping good stuff
__label__Positive	useful
__label__Negative	My order arrived in a bubble wrap envelope that DID NOT protect the gift card enclosure  The enclosure was crushed and bent and is not suitable as a gift
__label__Positive	The teddy bear is super cute and is a plus that it came with a gift card I purchased
__label__Positive	You can buy pseudo home cooked food with this thing while looking at pseudo antiques screwed to the wall with deck screws I know thats how I would display my collectables  All while enjoying what can only be described as the slowest service in the service industry  Or you can buy retro candy soft drinks or homey whimsical crap that is made in China but looks like it might be local  Keep in mind that the entire time you are magically transported to a time in America that never really existed Is it the 40s the 50swho cares  Other than World War II and the Korean conflict it was a care free time  All in all there is very little you cannot do with his plastic masterpiece inside a Cracker Barrel  Hookers in the parking lot however are an entirely different matter
__label__Positive	The meowing
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Got the card in the mail and everything worked out I am pleased
__label__Positive	yes it suited my needs just fine
__label__Positive	It was perfect
__label__Positive	Its great no plastic or paper  many items to choose from
__label__Positive	Very convenience
__label__Positive	it had the full amount and worked as expected
__label__Positive	What is a better gift than cash A gift card Really cool how you can email it to the recipient and even allow for lag time if you dont want them to receive it right away This was a very easy transaction I will buy gift cards online again
__label__Positive	wold recommend this as a gift for the yo ung ones birthdays or those who have graduatted high school and are off to college
__label__Positive	Our friends seem to appreciate these gift cards
__label__Negative	First of all despite the title of this product Free OneDay Shipping the final notification is that it will be delivered Dec 27 to 31 today is Dec 22 I bought it anyway in hopes that they will deliver as advertised Second AFTER I bought it I saw a review about receiving an empty box and that Amazon wouldnt do anything about that Well items shipped through the post office are insured for 50 and Im sure these are popular theft items so why whats up with that Im going to tell my son to bring his right over to the post office window and open it then and there since it sounds as if it will be after Christmas anyway so we can claim through insurance if its empty
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly at my store The cashier had used one before which made the transaction simple You have to have in entered manually on the card machine
__label__Positive	I dont know what happened  I sent a gift card from Amazon directly to recipient and it came back undeliverable as addressed  I doublechecked address thinking Id messed up but no address entered was exactly correct  So I dont know if it was the USPS or some glitch with Amazon and the address  Anyway ended up sending an electronic gift card and it worked fine  Glad its an option but I really did want to send via snail mail because its always nice to get something in your mailbox besides junk and bills
__label__Positive	esay way to sent and everybody likes it I love to get amazon gift card as a gift too hope you like it
__label__Positive	The gift card looks incredible it is so pretty and it like to everyone Thats perfect for this Christmas season
__label__Positive	I was able to change the greeting text to fit my needs  And then print the gift card myself  All very user friendly and everything done in just a few minutes  Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Packed in a cute tin and perfect for a teenager to be able to pick something out online
__label__Positive	Good stuff
__label__Positive	Love how cute this is
__label__Negative	The perfect gift for when you want the one you love to have a wide variety of choices to get exactly what they want
__label__Positive	This as simple So easy and they love it
__label__Positive	Quick and easy way to send a gift card
__label__Positive	Is very Good
__label__Positive	fast and convenient
__label__Positive	I ordered an Amazon Gift Card online for my sisterinlaw and received it the next day  She said it was a great idea and a great gift  She has already used her card and is so happy with her purchase  I love the different themes to choose from  I plan to purchase more to give to family and friends because it so convenient and everyone can find anything they want or need at Amazon
Thank you
__label__Positive	Love it
__label__Positive	Me encanta este producto considero que es una buena inversin que permite realizar comprar a futuro y aprovechar buenas ofertas
__label__Positive	I love how it doesnt expire and I love that I can buy it from the other side of the planet and am charged the exchange rate once
It is definitely the way to go if you are not in the US
__label__Positive	It was as advertised The only thing is I got rip off by the the person that received it I got took by a skam by Zopples I was to get 2 Ipads and that CARD was my payment I checked and they got their money So every body is happy but Me and my wife
__label__Positive	Comes in handy for the spur of the moment desire too eat at Applebees
__label__Positive	Gave this to my daughter who was thrilled
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for shoppers
__label__Positive	Bought Amazon gifts cards last year for my childs teachers and heard they were a big hit Ill be ordering again for this school year Packaging is really cute as well Cant go wrong
__label__Positive	I love the idea that I can order a gift card and it come very quickly for all my pet owner family and friends
__label__Positive	Delivered as promised
__label__Negative	False advertising  This was advertised as guaranteed delivery within one day  This is not true since my gift card took longer than one day to receive
__label__Positive	so sweet
__label__Negative	OK as is
__label__Positive	excellent
__label__Positive	My sis loved it
__label__Positive	Hey its cash who doesnt love cash
__label__Positive	It arrived when it shouldgreat
__label__Positive	Always great to give as gifts and that is what I did with this one
__label__Positive	Fit perfectly Easy to apply Product is as described No problems with protectors I have nothing to complain about with purchase
__label__Positive	This is a great way to get a gift card I will do this more often for r Kindle owners
__label__Positive	I find the Amazon gift registries slightly awkward since if the person registered for stuff at multiple stores there doesnt seem to be an option to buy multiple items in one fell swoop  But the gift card was perfect because you could just print it out and give to the recipient and they can buy what they want from their Amazon registry  Theres also an option to email the card to the recipient instead of printing but I wanted to actually take a gift to the shower so chose the print option
__label__Positive	Very pretty little box The popup insert is very creative and festive
__label__Positive	So  easy to send a gift
__label__Positive	Ok
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Cant beat gift cards
__label__Positive	It was a very appropriate design
__label__Positive	Works pretty well I can easily transfer the balance to another Hotelscom GC
__label__Positive	Great service products as advertised fair pricesit is a pleasure dealing with Amazon and we look forward to many more years of positive experiences
__label__Positive	EVeryone loves the gift card
__label__Positive	Will use the gift card as a weddingshower gift
__label__Positive	My grandchild loved it  It was a Valentines gift and I never know what to get her so this time around I let her choose something she wanted herself  Very cute
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card  easy for buyer and receiver gets what they want
__label__Positive	Great gift for someone you have no idea what to buy Very fast arrival I buy these frequently Never had any issues getting them on time
__label__Positive	Ok
__label__Positive	For everyone who has been having problems with this giftcard Try to use the giftcard on your cell phone like this other reviewer said when I tried putting the giftcard on my computer it said invalid code but when i used it on my phone it worked like a charm Then I went on my computer refreshed my cart and my giftcard was applied and i continued the rest of the order placement Also the card arrived 5 minutes after placing the order Great and quick delivery I didnt have to wait for the card to arrive in mail I took one point off because it should be able to work on the computer too I dont know how many people lost their money thinking that their card doesnt work but it actually works
__label__Positive	Love it
__label__Positive	Everything went according to plan and no hiccups whatsoever I knew I could count on Amazon very happy overall
__label__Positive	Love that I can get the cards someone wants Amazon or others and make it all happen from home
__label__Positive	Great for those on Christmas list that I know they also like shopping on Amazon
__label__Positive	I purchased this for my children that live in a different town two hours away  They love this little treat coming every now and then and Amazon makes it easy for a one stop shopping experience  The shipping was fast and there were no problems with delivery  Customer Service was Excellent

I highly recommend trying Amazon for all your gift card needs
__label__Positive	Excellent way to send a gift long distance plus  I know they will enjoy looking on the site for just what they wanted

__label__Positive	I bought some gift cards for my kids so they could purchase some things on their kindle fire Very easy to purchase and great for the kids so they could buy what they wanted Like the ease of it
__label__Negative	Gave this as a gift and they just tried to use and the card had nothing on it What carp
__label__Positive	I bought this gift card for my friend The box is very creative My friend like it very well This is a great stuff
__label__Positive	Perfect gift was greatly appreciated and put to good use Will do it again for other gifts
__label__Positive	Buy by this way is very easy and flexible I recommend it to people who wants to make a gift and dont know what to give in another countries is very useful
__label__Neutral	I wanted to order 100 of the 100 gift cards but your qty restrictions forced me to place multiple orders in different denominations in order to get all the gift cards I needed
I should be able to order in 10pks and get as many packs as I want
Why do you restrict qty
__label__Positive	I have 3granddaughters who just love Build a Bear so for their birthdays Christmas and any holiday I ask what they want and its always the same BuildaBear
__label__Positive	quick shipment cant go wrong
__label__Positive	Very good and fast shipping
__label__Positive	Amazoncom gift cards are very easy to purchase

and great for anyone especially those whom seem

to have everything  I also like the predesigned cards  little thinking required
__label__Negative	My gift card recipient here in Australia had a very difficult time trying to use the card to purchase Kindle books She pleaded with Kindle staff over the phone to be able to redeem her credit and finally they made an exception for her Would not buy one of these again
__label__Positive	Great gift idea
__label__Positive	This is perfect anytime but especially when you are late with getting something mailed The best part The recipient loves it too
__label__Positive	easy and fast
__label__Positive	Such a great way to gift someone and not have to worry if they already received the same gift  Love the simplicity of giving the gift that everyone loves and its at their fingertips
__label__Positive	I sent this gift card to my teaching assistant in my school  She was very pleased with it  It was a little difficult to order because there were many options and a lot of pages to navigate through
__label__Positive	I have never visited the Amazoncom site until I received a gift card from my sister  What an awesome gift  I was so scared to even buy anything online but it was so easy and Amazoncom made redeeming my gift card stress free
__label__Positive	How can you screw up a giftcard
__label__Positive	1st time use  will use again  Thanks
__label__Neutral	good
__label__Positive	I gave Amazon gift cards to my staff this year and they loved them  I would do it again in a heartbeat

__label__Negative	When trying to add the code on the card to the account we got the message that the code was invalid Five separate calls to customer service did not resolve this and we still have not been able to use the card Ive had many many cards previously with no problem but it was the inability of customer service to resolve the issue that was most disappointing

__label__Negative	PS4 OWNERS not worth your money if you dont plan on using multiplayer The free games for PS4 users for the last 2 years have been a complete and utter joke extremely little value if you dont obsess over indie games Expect very little quality titles laughable sales on indie games that youll get for free next month anyway and very rarely theyll ask you which indie game you want next month Waste of money use it to buy a game you like instead
__label__Positive	Terrific Arrived quickly Easily printable and usable Hits the spot
__label__Positive	Excellent  Everyone wanted to know if I paid extra for it
__label__Positive	Nice item However they failed to inform us to include a personal greeting My son had to figure who sent it Dr h Koppelman
__label__Positive	Birthday gift for my daughter This is what she asked for and she was not disappointed
__label__Positive	Convenient My daughter lived the cute email
__label__Positive	What can you saywho doesnt love an Amazon gift card Recipients were very appreciative I like that there are a variety of designs to choose from for every occasion I liked the animation available so that even if you are sending digitally it seems like an actual card
__label__Positive	Came quick and super cute
__label__Positive	I love octopus This one is cute and I like it My friend loves it I dont know if it has real card version I will get it next time
__label__Positive	Grandkids loved it  I hope you expand your selection
__label__Positive	Its a gift card at a great price What more is there to say
__label__Positive	It was so easy to get my niece a baby gift even tho shes several states away
__label__Positive	Gift card was wrapped in a cute package and shipping was extremely fast
__label__Positive	gift card
__label__Positive	It was just what I wanted  Nothing like a gift card for some place you know your loved ones appreciate
__label__Positive	it fasteasyand perfect
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	You know that emergency gift that you always need at the last moment If the person needing it has a Kindle this is the perfect way to go Its fast and you dont need to worry about them not liking the gift you chose for them It is a bit impersonal though so the fact that you can choose the appearance can make it a bit more personal
__label__Positive	Came on time for his birthday party
__label__Positive	Very nicely boxeda nice presentation
__label__Positive	got it
__label__Positive	Made a great gift
__label__Positive	Very easy Got it right away
__label__Positive	Received card as a Christmas gift from my son

I used it to by three books for my Kindle There was some left over so I used it towards another purchase
__label__Positive	Very cute
__label__Negative	Doesnt seem to work for me unfortunately and I also really didnt appreciate the spam emails and phone calls from the company
__label__Positive	Kids loved it
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	Excellent Christmas gift
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with a gift card
__label__Positive	Results of photo on canvass was one of my Amazon orders of some four dozen over the years that gave me a feeling of complete pleasure and satisfaction

Now all I need is more wall space to accommodate future orders

My new law of physics is that walls abhore too much open space

__label__Negative	I wanted to send a monetary Gift card to a friend in the UK
All went well until he received notice and tried to retrieve it Mind you I was charged as if I had purchased an item for delivery
He was unable to retrieve it as Amazon UK and Amazon USA are separate and therefore he could not get his gift
No warning before hand nothing
I called Amazon and they explained that there was nothing they could do
I had to go through the entire process of return and get credit

Thats my story
Fred Auebach
__label__Positive	So easy to get and give
__label__Positive	Exactly what I expected from a gift card
__label__Positive	My gf and my little sister loved this as a stocking stuffer
__label__Negative	I thought it was just a gift card that would be sent with the 5000 Amazon card I intended to send  Instead it was a 5000 gift card for a theatre that does not even exist in the part of the country where my daughter and soninlaw live I will not use Amazon as a gift giving card ever again  I will send a personal bank check instead  I have wasted 5000 which will not be used again  Darn
__label__Positive	worked
__label__Positive	A personal touch in a gift card is great  I live in Spain one of my daugthers lives in Miami and my son lives in Amsterdam so amazon gift cards are the easiest way I can send a gift to them Besides we all love low prices and big stocks of Amazon
__label__Positive	I forgot my sisters birthday  She is in NY Im in California  Logged in and in 2 minutes she had a gift  She loved the card
__label__Positive	printable immediately  good gifting for procrastinators like me
__label__Negative	Was a present for an avid Kindle reader  Felt a fool when it would not work on buying Amazon kindle products via the Australian website  Ended up being a waste of money  Even looked at the Amazoncom website for items  More expensive than buying locally  What a waste of time and money  Will never buy one again
__label__Positive	BECAUSE ITS ACCEPTED AS A PAY METHOD
__label__Neutral	Giftcard came as advertised but you can get better designs right across the street at Starbucks
__label__Negative	I have always had great luck with Amazon gift cards via email so I assumed a physical gift card would be just as great  I was wrong

I ordered this gift card as a Christmas present for my sister  I purchased it on Amazoncom and had it shipped directly to her  Next day shipping was perfect given that I waited until the last minute to do Christmas shopping but thats where the good part of this card ended  When my sister tried to enter the claim code on the card she got an error message saying there was something wrong with the claim code  She emailed customer service and the response she got was that she needed to have the sender me contact the store I bought the card from to have it activated  Let me remind you that I purchased this card on Amazoncom

So I got in touch with customer service via the online chat option and was told that my issue would have to be elevated to the gift card team and that the card could be activated in 24 to 48 hours  I told the customer service rep that this was not an acceptable option  Then the customer service rep said hed see what he could do and came back with the response that I need to go to the store I bought the card from and have make sure the store activates it  Let me remind you yet again that I bought this card from Amazoncom

Then I gave the customer service rep the cards claim code and the Amazoncom order number  The next response I got was that the gift cards claim code did not match up with what was listed for the order number  Ugh  At this point the customer service rep suggested handing this off to the gift card team which I agreed to  A few hours later I got an email saying that my credit card would be refunded for this purchase  I never asked for a refund just wanted to get the gift card working but in a round about way it did solve my problem because I then went ahead and bought an email gift certificate and that worked perfectly

After this experience with the card not working and the repeated suggestion from customer service to go to the store I purchased the card from and have them activate it when I did in fact buy it on Amazoncom I would definitely steer away from the physical gift card and go for the email version instead
__label__Positive	My grandson will love this gift card
__label__Positive	EXCELENTE
__label__Neutral	Not sure where I was able to endorse it or say who it was from I wish Amazon offered more denominations for all gift cards
__label__Positive	The gift card package is great  especially for those who shop on Amazon a lot
__label__Positive	I love amazon gift cards because you can buy them and they deliver instantly or you can set a particular time  date for it to deliver in the future I like that I can order this from wherever and whenever
What I like most is that it tells you when the recipient receives it So this particular card I didnt realize that I mistyped my recipients email address until after I did not receive that confirmation Once I realized the problem I thought oh no But it took a couple clicks and it was all fixed I didnt have to call or anything It was fantastic
I dont know how amazon could make this whole experience more convenient And everyone looooves amazon cards
__label__Positive	I bought these just as a gift and a great night of marvel view fun But well Im pretty sure these ended up changing my gender
I identify as a packing peanut now but its fine prolly a phase
__label__Positive	gift
__label__Positive	PERFECT gift for outofstate teenage grandchildren  They really enjoy shopping with credits and their wants are just foreign to me
__label__Positive	Great being able to email a gift card so it isnt lost in mail or delayed in delivery
__label__Positive	I know its just a gift card but it came super quick I really love that about amazon
__label__Positive	I bought this gift card for my husband and he got Alexa with it
__label__Positive	A special PrePaid Outing
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card program asks one to 1st choose a photo then fill in the required information but once you enter in the required information the photo disappears After several tries to reenter the photo I gave up  finished the program then added the photo Ahh then it works Amazon needs to look into this The person that received the card got fast service  was very pleased He even started an Amazon Wish List
__label__Positive	yep
__label__Positive	Worked out well
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for my soninlaw so he could get something for himself that he would actually like He was bowled over
__label__Negative	If the recipient had ever received this gift I would think more highly of your service  I wrote you requesting a resend which never occurred finally I printed a hard copy of my confirmation and sent it to him since you were unable to do so
__label__Positive	Love giving a gift everyone enjoys
__label__Positive	Was delivered no problems Awesome for a dad out of state
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	useful for gifting
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	First time using a gift card for someone else and not too proficient in the passing on the passcode for that soldier to use it  But Amazon got it working
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Positive	Gift for Christmas  loved the packaging and delivered as requested
__label__Positive	It is so easy to buy and print a gift card from Amason its the perfect last minute gift I also like all the options to choose from
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Negative	Lamest food ever
__label__Positive	This is the perfect gift It allowed me the freedom to choose from thousands of items I highly recommend it
__label__Positive	I got these right on time and had no problem I was a little scared at first that no money was going to be added but amazon came through took them right to gamestop and used them for some new stuff
__label__Positive	I love coffee so thanks
__label__Positive	Worked just fine
__label__Positive	My Dad loved his birthday present Was so easy and hasslefree
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt love an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Superb and instant delivery very happy
__label__Positive	This was perfect because I live in Venezuela and we have limited access to buy in dollars with credit card so I just buoght 3 gift cards with different cards and bought what i wanted Thaks amazon for this option
__label__Positive	The 10 cards make excellent gifts for individuals who do service work for you  Doctor offices rescue hospital police restaurants fire dept teachers plumbers electricians handy persons letter carrier delivery like our GO BOLTS DAVE from FedEx neighbors teenagers etc
__label__Positive	It was packed good No complaints
__label__Positive	Good  gift  for a little  girl
__label__Positive	Perfect last minute gift
__label__Neutral	I thought I was buying a Gift Card IN A BOX Disappointed Thats how my last one came I could have just handed my son a plastic card I wont buy a Gift Card again
__label__Positive	Save 5 on your Netflix subscription buying this with your amazon card and the amazon prime subscription
Cant beat that deal
__label__Positive	Purchased the gift received right away and applied to the Step fathers account
Ease of use for the website

Only issue I ever had was a couple of years ago didnt realize that purchasing on com vs ca was not compatible However I called and got correctedprocess is very easy to use buy every year
__label__Positive	Comes in handy
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	Amazon did a great job Very happy
__label__Positive	Great system I live in UK My family live in Tucson So am able to give them what they want Know items will be delivered on time
__label__Positive	Hop she ikes it Not given yet
__label__Positive	We are a Kindle family from the youngest 4 to the oldest 83 Because of that no matter what the occasion an Amazon gift card is always welcome
__label__Positive	THIS GIFT CARD IS EASY TO USE  BUT I THINK AMAZON COULD GIVE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF INTEREST GAIN BY THE TIME WITHOUT USE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
__label__Positive	Just what I ordered Such a good option for a gift to a movie lover
__label__Positive	I really enjoyed personalizing the gift card by using a photo and my own caption  It was easy to do and well received
__label__Negative	I sent this to the wrong email and I want cancel it but there is no where I can cancel this order  I need to do another one for the correct order but it seems as though it will charge me twice Also I have tried to used the promo code 1215GCARDS  and this does not work at all for me  There is no where on this site that it provides me information on cancelling a giftcard order or even editing
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Easy to send and appreciated by all
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Yep the gift card size was about the size of all other gift cards
__label__Positive	My sister thought it was fun and cute
__label__Positive	Great EBirthday Card Love Hoops and Yoyo
__label__Positive	Gift for my son hes very pleased
__label__Positive	Beautiful card with gift card built in Lovely
__label__Positive	I had never been to a Red Robin Gourmet Burger location before July 2016  I have enjoyed my two visits there thus far
__label__Positive	Best ever
__label__Positive	Just fine
__label__Positive	Made my day when husband and daughters gave me over 200 in Amazon gift cards  I love to see the birthday bird flying into my life
__label__Positive	Excellent gift was well reciprocated
__label__Positive	We bought this as a gift obviously for some really good friends and they totally loved it The packaging was thoughtful and the case really made a good impression than just the gift card itself I definitely prefer this than the single gift card option Besides it doesnt cost extra
__label__Positive	Its a gift card for free food  no complaints 
__label__Negative	I send this gift card and after sometime recipient called me and said  it has no value It was so embarrassing  I contacted amazon and representative said it has been used  I will never ever suggest anyone to use amazon gift card service  I should have gone to JCP website and send it
__label__Positive	Perfect transition Thank you
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	A great selection of gift cards but this one is really cute for someone who has a golden lab
__label__Positive	a nice gift
__label__Positive	Nice way to get a gift card
__label__Positive	As always everything was smoothly processed  My Granddaughter received her gift with plenty of time  Thanks
__label__Positive	I dont know how it looks when he got the email but he almost deleted it so it wasnt the surprise I hoped for
__label__Positive	Bought for my nephews birthday
__label__Positive	Bicycling Bear Gift Card  Fun
__label__Positive	The card was a great hit I still laugh every time I play the video
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	The Amazon Kindle gift card is quite literally the gift that keeps on giving  and I say that personal experience  I received a 50 gift card myself last year and Im still redeeming great books 12 months later  thats phenomenal value

Ill admit Im typically swayed by a good book bargain so my purchases have been made with value in mind  but that doesnt minimize the quality  Ive read some cracking books 

And whilst Im usually not one to give gift cards preferring a more personal touch to gifts I do highly recommend the Amazon Kindle gift card  for both value  breadth of book choices

Ive been so chuffed with my gift card that Ive since purchased cards for 2 friends  which theyve loved
__label__Positive	This was a Christmas gift and was appreciated by the receiver
__label__Negative	Was helping a friend at midnight and store closes at 1 am Card NEVER came 21st century and a card cant be emailed even within 15 mins Its pretty sad

I will not be buy any Dominos gift cards  at least Pizza Hut has their act together
__label__Positive	Perfect Christmas gift for adults who like to pick their own gitts  Cute presentation too
__label__Positive	Personal gift perfect gift card
__label__Positive	Super easy and quick
__label__Positive	I recieved a Kindle for my Birthday Christmas along with 2 Amazon gift cards I really am impressed with the selection of books available and have already used most of the gift cards credits Very happy with the products
__label__Positive	Makes a great gift
__label__Positive	This is just what I was looking for as it made my grandson really happy
__label__Neutral	I sent a gift card by Amazon and now they want me to rate it  It did what I expected I DO like that I can send gifts this way to family that is out of the country and that my propensity to procrastinate doesnt prevent me from getting a gift to a relative on time  Also there is a lot to choose from on Amazon so the gift cards seem to be really appreciated by the recipients especially the gamers and the music lovers
__label__Positive	I always love to get Amazon Gift Cards as gifts from friends and for my friends and the fact that this one comes already in a cute little package that looks like a gift box makes it the perfect gift or even stocking stuffer for just anyone Its also the right price for a gift exchange  Just perfect
__label__Positive	my grandkids love to buy what they want not what I think they want  This is a wonderful solution to birthday holiday graduation and just cause I love them presents
__label__Neutral	I received the item really fast so I gave it a three star The box looks nice on the picture but it was totally scratched and damaged when I receive it The package was not damaged but the box was
__label__Positive	Great value
__label__Positive	convenient way to give
__label__Positive	Quick and easy gift for my son He enjoyed it
__label__Positive	My CNAs loved  THEIR GIFT CARDS
__label__Positive	Cute little way to give an Amazon gift card These made the perfect Christmas presents
__label__Positive	Excellent arrived very next day as promised
__label__Positive	It is a gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift for everyone
__label__Positive	Quick and simple Easy to acquire
__label__Positive	It worked as advertised I got the email immediately after purchase and used it at Panera the next day without issue
__label__Negative	Warning The claim code is easily scratched off when removing the silver covering and Amazon makes it difficult to recover the money on the gift card

It appears that the claim code is just a sticker with a silver sticker over top to cover the code so when you scratch it off its easy to scratch off both claim code with the silver top Amazon customer service was unable to claim the money on the gift card
__label__Positive	When you want to be sure to please and all else fails an AMAZON GIFT CARD is always the best solution To me giving money directly means it will be put in the pot and never truly thought of as a gift When the honoree can make a choice of something special it will be remembered
__label__Positive	great
__label__Neutral	The card didnt work at Ulta Hoping Amazon can fix it

Update With some effort I was given a credit for the amount on the card Upping the stars to reflect this Not sure I would buy gift cards through Amazon again though
__label__Positive	excellent product look excellent in that metal box 
__label__Positive	Wonderful service Awesome products
__label__Positive	Nice way to package
__label__Positive	Love it it was adorable  great last minute idea
great delivery easy to use

She loved it

very wonderful gift idea
__label__Positive	It was a gift  the recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Nice present for a baby shower we were unable to attend
__label__Neutral	Card design options that you can select are really nice I opted for the card  gift box combination when ordered  Delivery was indeed next day at no additional cost  a real plus

Package arrived in a large mailing envelope with built in bubble wrap but this did not appear to protect the box  Either handling was really rough or when the card was inserted into the box at Amazon and placed into shipment not a lot of care was exercised

The gift box was meant to be part of the presentation and it detracted from it  I tried repairs as much as I could and got it to an acceptable condition just wish it was not necessary
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	Such a great way to purchase so many great things on Amazon The birthday gift loved it I would purchase another one in the future
__label__Positive	I love these printable gift cards they are perfect for last minute gifts
__label__Positive	Received almost instantly A great birthday party saver for myself and the kids Thanks
__label__Positive	You can use ar multiple restaurants
__label__Positive	Bought as a Christmas gift Movie cards are always great
__label__Positive	Easy and he got just what he wanted with the card purchase
__label__Positive	Didnt expect it
__label__Positive	Cute
__label__Positive	Seems silly to review a gift card but it was delivered on time and was well received
__label__Positive	Love this snowflake tin Perfect for the holidays
__label__Positive	She has already used the card
__label__Positive	Convenient Just added the personalization printed and got to hand it to the receiver in person Instant gift giving She loved it
__label__Positive	The gift card was a birthday gift to my sister  The transaction went very smooth and she was very happy with the gift card as she loves to shop on Amazon
__label__Positive	This is one way to add to my account I wonder if there is an easier way
__label__Positive	Great XMas gift fast and easy
__label__Positive	Very easy and will do this again Thanks
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Nice to make something special for someone special

__label__Positive	my sister was delighted
__label__Positive	Love it
__label__Positive	Great deal
__label__Positive	Not expected but came in handy
__label__Positive	I really like purchasing gift cards from Amazon but this is the second one Ive purchased that the recipient could not get to work without calling customer service Is there a way to insure that a purchase can be applied to an individuals account so the purchase of the card is linked to the recipient
__label__Positive	I like these gift card holders I just wish they all popped up to display the gift card Only two in this set do one of them is just a little gift bag to put the gift cards in  Overall they are really nice though and well made
__label__Positive	Worked beautifully
__label__Positive	Didnt have time to get my son a gift I knew he loved Amazon shopping and bought so many things from them So I bought him an Amazon Gift Card He loved it Im sure he spent it in a heartbeat but it was good to know he was happy with his gift
__label__Positive	I loved my Starbucks card it meet all my needs

__label__Positive	Great package
__label__Positive	Love gift cards Great way to show special people you care about them
__label__Positive	Great for out of town or last minute shopping for loved ones I Would definitely purchase again for holidays or special occasions
__label__Positive	Always a good gift Lets be honest who doesnt have an amazon wish list This is a good one for sure
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always good Even better to get it immediately
__label__Negative	Im disappointed as I was told my gift card would be delivered on Friday and its now Saturday evening and it still hasnt been deliveredI havent a clue who or how to contact anyone  The tracking number leads me to the same place each time and its more than a state awayThis was a getwell gift that I really wanted delivered on time
__label__Positive	The Child I bought it for was very happy with his gift when left the hospital Thank you 
__label__Positive	My sister helped me with a horrific project She is brilliant and generousso i SURPRISED HER with a thank you gift100 for amazon stuff  she texted me when she received it that she just laughed so hard and so long at hoops and yoyoso i got her to laugh AND surprised her with gratitude  We live about 800 miles apart and i never get to see her so its hard to know what kind of object gift to get hershe and her husband used the money for bedding up at their lake house so she sent me a photo once they got it and put it on their bed  I have REALLY GOOD taste in home furnishings LOL
__label__Neutral	I ordered this  with it got a free one day delivery I didnt get it But I contacted amazon  they sent me another one the exact same as I ordered free of charge  I received it the next day The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I didnt get it the first time The box it comes in is exactly as pictured  the card itself looks nice I would order again
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Quick service and just as advertised These cards make little ones very happy They get to choose which makes it easy
__label__Positive	its a gift card I guess it works the way it supposed to
__label__Positive	This worked really well for I read that in certain subway areas I might not be able to use this so I was skeptical I am glad that I did purchase this I had some amazon reward points to use up It really helped to have a card for a qhick lunch or dinner on the go I went to three different subways in and around the Austin area and this card worked fine in all of them
__label__Positive	I love to get gift cards They are easy to put on my account and fun to use I can use them for anything on this site
__label__Positive	Everything went well
__label__Negative	it has been two weeks and no gift card yet It was a deal of the day

__label__Positive	SWEET Very cute Mothers Day animated card
__label__Positive	I love the presentation of the card Too bad you can only order one per household Would like to purchase more
__label__Positive	It was fast and easy  there doesnt need to be 15 words Straight to the point  this is why people dont want to do surveys
__label__Positive	Great Easy to load
__label__Positive	Easy to acquire and can get you out of a tight spot at the last minute
__label__Positive	Happy to receive it

__label__Positive	very nice

__label__Positive	exelent

PURCHASED FEB 9TH 2017

I live in Phoenix Arizona and purchased this gift card too buy gas I went in to the actual store to speak to some one in customer service to make sure the barcode I had printed out was valid

YOU DO NEED TO PRINT OUT

When printed out it has a barcode and instructions for the cashier She said that the people having trouble are not following the proper instruction
I had no issue using the barcode and purchased both gas and groceries All you have too do is make sure that the cashier is using it properly if not have them call the customer service manager and they should be able to help
__label__Positive	We use these gift cards as a way to thank our colleagues on special occasions They could not be easier to purchase and send We highly recommend them
__label__Positive	A happy birthday wish
__label__Positive	Convenient gift for someone to use for their own choices
__label__Positive	Received the card on time  I had no issues using it  Used it twice in fact  Worked both times  I did have an issue when I went to check the balance on their website  It said it was an invalid card  I called the customer service number on the back of the card and it said that there was 25 on there  I talked to a representative just to make sure and it said sometimes the website is glitchy  So if you check online and it says invalid just call the number on the back
__label__Positive	Great last minute gift
__label__Positive	We needed a birthday gift for an eightyyearold male who likes to read Not knowing his reading history the gift card allowed us to give him something he can use and enjoy
The  gift card box had a masculine look I was concerned about the word Amazon being printed all over the box but the charcoal on black colors made the word into a subtle striped pattern design
__label__Positive	I love Steak n Shake  Great burgers fries and oh those shakes
__label__Positive	Restaurant is great Will use gift card for a celebration when family comes in so it will be perfect to have
__label__Positive	Very nice present
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Like the gift card easy quick way to give someone a present or just make it easier for yourself to order Nice gift box came with it too
__label__Positive	The Amazon Gift Card was the best thing ever  I just got my new Kindle and absolutely love it along with the Gift Cards that my family purchased so that I could start loading books to my Kindle which only took seconds  Best ever not to mention the Kindle is now the only way I read my books

Love my family
__label__Positive	Arrived on time
__label__Positive	Good product
__label__Positive	Given as a shower gift  She LOVED it
__label__Positive	The beautiful thing about purchasing an Amazon gift card is three fold  You can shop in your pjs its basically one click shopping and the recipient is sure to find something that pleases  An added bonus you can print a personalized gift card to suit the occasion  It doesnt get any simpler than that
__label__Positive	Ordered for one of my granddaughters who is a huge fan of Gordmans  She was very pleased
__label__Positive	Really enjoyed and had immediate plans for purchase
__label__Positive	When I didnt receive the item I called to put out a trace of the gift card numbers They responded immediately
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Positive	I liked the card well enough  It was clear brief and  effective

However though asked to pay through a gift card by tvtreasures4u for a DVD series Return to Eden 1983 TV mini series  1 free DVD I ordered the package has not yet arrived  When I wrote to the seller heshe just asked me to restate my address so that heshe would resend  To date the package has not arrived

Thanks and regards

__label__Positive	She loves it
__label__Positive	My grandson Jet loved it  I got to hear his voice when he called to thank me
__label__Positive	Amazon gift card how wrong can you go
__label__Positive	Great way to buy a gift  just pay the amount you want to spend and  print the card with the code
__label__Positive	The amazon gift card is an excellent option it is very easy to way i ordered to arrive to an email this arrive very fast and you use the code for whatever object or equipment you want to buy without any problem and i made very quickly i spend more time looking what i bought the rest is quick
__label__Neutral	I got my gift card quickly And it was loaded with the correct amount Unfortunately they limit customers to one per person per account and will never allow you to buy another one This is poor on amazons part Let me know when you find someone who doesnt repeat orders for an iTunes gift card Not going to get more than a three star because this is a big factor to me
__label__Negative	Gift cards are nice but after calling Amazon a couple times before ordering one to ask questions I was still disappointed  My recipient was overseas and could not find anything they would deliver there  They did give me my money back however
__label__Positive	Gift card was perfect
__label__Positive	Quick and easy the receiver was delighted to purchase just what she would like
__label__Positive	It is very fast First time when I bought egift card to my brother birthday he didnt check his email and I didnt get message saying he got it Then I went back online to read reviews some people said they paid but they didnt get the card because their email address are different from the ones they sent  So I canceled it however I just canceled I got email saying my card received  then one min Later my ecard canceled

Then i learned that you have to have a little bit patient to wait  it wont take that long if the email you sent on your contact list that s the fastest  probably within a half hour
__label__Positive	Super easy and my dad loved it
__label__Positive	Delivered promptly to my niece to get something specialshe spent it all on her children
__label__Positive	My grandson and I both loved the card and I was very pleased with  how fast the delivery was

__label__Positive	Everybody likes amazon gift cards especially in a nice looking box
__label__Positive	Its a gift card You know Not a toy or an item you cherish for life BUT it comes in very handy for other amazoncom shoppers you know Therefore it works
__label__Positive	Ive given gift cards for birthdays Christmas and rewards Kids love them Parents love them Whats not to love My only complaint not being able to reprint gift card because the credit card account number used for the purchase was no longer good Seems there needs to be another way to verify purchases
__label__Positive	Got this on a special so it was a good deal  I used it already and it worked fine
__label__Positive	Received fast service for a family member who lives in Costa Rica A great way to send gifts I recommend this for everyone
__label__Positive	helpful and easy way to send love and gifts across the miles and know they will be received on the special day
__label__Positive	Cute bear is an added bonus to the gift card  What could go wrong  Cant wait till this year
__label__Positive	Such a convenient and safe way to make a gift I use this often when I dont know what else to give
__label__Positive	amazon gift cards are great because you can find almost anything you want on amazon having the option to choose anything is fun
__label__Positive	My son and his girlfriends favorite place to eat thus the perfect gift card 
__label__Positive	Delivery within a few minutes We ate a lot of breadsticks No regrets

__label__Positive	Great way to say thank you

__label__Positive	yeah
__label__Positive	This was a great way to involve my son in thanking his teacher for her hard work  He colored it and they appreciated being able to pick out something they could really use
__label__Negative	You have to physically print out the damn thing in order to use it and even then there are restrictions on what you can actually use it for None of this is mentioned on the card or anything so Id recommend avoiding this one
__label__Positive	Everything was fine with the catd
__label__Positive	great for the holiday
__label__Positive	yay movies
__label__Positive	Great immediate service
__label__Positive	I used the gift card option because the person that it was sent to uses AMAZON  So I knew it would be greatly appreciate
__label__Positive	Perfect goto gift when you wake up and realize everything else on the registry has been bought
__label__Positive	Anytime you receive a free gift it usually turns out to be a good thing This actually turned out to be a great thing  My wife had been wanting to go to Red Robin for a while now so this was a great way to do that The funny part is that not only was our gift card for 25 our meal was 25 even We didnt spend one cent and our food was fantastic Thanks to Amazon for the great gift It was greatly appreciated
__label__Positive	Push me speed more money Ha ha 
__label__Positive	Worked great 
__label__Positive	A great hasslefree way to send gift cards to family and friends Highly recommended for birthdays and many other occasions
__label__Positive	Fast shipping Loved the box the gift card came in
__label__Negative	This card was purchased for 40 for 50 card on sale The card that came was not credited with 50 rather 25 The restaurant where the card was used would not check help or indicate how to go about seeking resolution Subsequently I am still without a path to get this fixed As it stands I am out some money and have no definable path for correction
__label__Positive	Feel kinda weird reviewing a Gift Certificate but I thought I should because I was impressed with amazons packaging The gift came in a pretty sturdy box with decent quality ribbon We had purchased it for a friends wedding present and it was nice enough where we were able to just give it to the couple with a card attached No need to wrap or throw in a bag  So if ever in doubt on a gift this is a good one to buy Purchase and Done
__label__Positive	Really cute Love the bear
__label__Positive	The Amazon Gift Card worked well for me because my daughter lives out of the area and the gift card allowed me to send it to her via email  She was able to use it to buy something that she wantedneeded to celebrate her first Mothers Day  She was very pleased
__label__Positive	Makes gift giving so easy  Love the printing capability so it can be hand delivered when that is desired  Also great for last minute gifts
__label__Positive	good

My mom recently had to take a trip to the ER My younger brother called me to tell me he needed a quick fix for dinner that night because he didnt want to bother mom as she recovered Im three hours away at college  didnt have the time to transfer cash or order it myself I sent them a gift card with a quick swipe during my lunch break  little bro handled the rest He said it was easy peasy Weve had trouble with other e gift cards like Walmart where its such a chore to get someone in the store to know where to scan a printed bar code All little bro had to do was tell dominos folks the number and they had dinner delivered I def will order again

__label__Positive	very nice
__label__Positive	I have had no issues with this item Purchased it got it in my email within five minutes printed it out took it to the store the clerk scanned it just like a regular gift card For those working on Mechanical Turk you cannot purchase this with your Amazon Payments balance But you CAN load your earnings onto your Amazon gift card balance and purchase it that way
__label__Negative	On December 19 2011 I ordered 2 boxes of Amazon Giftcards to be mailed to my son and daughterinlaw in  Texas each box contains 2 50 giftcards  They live in a 3story condo bldg the ground floor is the parking garage  The UPS delivery person dropped off the boxes at 630pm on December 21 2011  their front door without ringing the door bell or knocking at the door It was dark already both boxes were stolen the thief took the cards and threw the empty boxes  a neighbors front door I cant believe when I heard my son told me that the outside of the box has large print which reads AMAZON GIFT CARDS  Who in the world will do such a dumb thing

After talking to an Amazon reprsentative my credit card account was credited for 20000  The representative could not answer my question regarding whether the giftcard has any log in requirements before using it  I like Amazon but I will never purchase any Amazon Giftcards by mail again I have never mailed any giftcards to anybody and I will never do that either Do it electronically Lesson learned
__label__Positive	Purchased this for the other half as part of her valentines day gift Shipping was pretty slow on this week and a half so if you need this quickly make sure to order early or pay extra for quick shipping
__label__Positive	EAsy gift for friends
__label__Positive	Gave to my wife for Christmas she has kept the box because its so cool  Yes and she loved the card as well lol

__label__Positive	Such a pretty card  It brought joy to someone special  Thank you Amazon
__label__Positive	Can you believe they all paused to admire the craftsmanship of the packaging itself They loved the little box it came in
__label__Positive	I have purchased many gift cards in the past this is probably the easiest to redeem I like to get them and many of my friends like to receive them
__label__Positive	great gift for anniversary
__label__Positive	We purchased three gift cards for my nieces  nephew who love 2500 miles away Uploading personal pictures on the gift cards was easy  the kids loved the personalized picture  message on each gift card So easy to redeem  everyone can buy something they really want The gift cards were a hit  I would definitely purchase them again

__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Whats not to like Sending gift card  Cant go wrong It was a success Great delivery and great customer service
__label__Positive	Great gift

__label__Positive	Can not make a mistake Always right size
__label__Positive	Super packaging and well received as a Christmas gift
__label__Positive	I bought the Amazon gift card cause at the time I couldnt think of a birthday gift  for my son in law And I knew he would enjoy something like this cause he could use the gift card to get something he liked

__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	cant go wrong for Xmas
__label__Positive	Simple and elegant

__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card is the best way to give gifts to someone when you have no clue what to buy
__label__Positive	Given as gifts  All were happy
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	It would have been nice for you to wait until I actually received the gift card before you asked me to rate it How do you know when i would receive the gift card well you could assume anytime after my actual birthday  Instead I receive the request to rate the gift card not even 12 hours into my actual birth date Now I will have to act surprised when they give me the gift card
__label__Positive	Just as described and fast shipping Overall happy
__label__Positive	Its the most efficient way to send a suddenly needed gift and everybody loves something from Amazon Its really wellthought out to offer a variety of attractive choices that can be emailed as soon as you wish
__label__Positive	I like the ability to choose a design online add a dolalr amount and send a gift electronically  Some might say its impersonal I think its VERY convenient and fits well into our busy hightech lives  Plus my family shops AMAZON a LOT so a gift certificate is always appreciated
__label__Positive	Speaks for itself
Bought a bunch of stuff that i normally would not buy lol Great gift
Get this gift and you wont have to wait in lines at the mall 
__label__Positive	I like this because family members who are in different parts of the world can get the card as a gift and choose their gift  It also eliminates hefty mail charges which at times can be as much as the gift itself
__label__Positive	Thank you very good
__label__Neutral	What can I say It is a gift card
__label__Positive	Order came in fast no need to hesitate if youre already looking to purchase a gift card for someone
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for anyone
__label__Positive	the actual gift card was nice however the boxing was a disappointment the ribbon on the box turned out to be orange not golden yellow as pictured this was a Christmas gift and the orange was inappropriate  I ended up pulling the box apart to remove the ribbon
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an Amazon gift card Seriously if there is someone who doesnt I know who does  EVERYONE ELSE

__label__Positive	Ok
__label__Negative	Unfortunately this did not turn out as planned I ordered this for a special birthday The gift card did arrive but no birthday card Amazon was unable to send the card separately They gave me a small credit but that didnt fix the missing birthday card I am not sure if I would try it again
__label__Neutral	The loved it once they got it  But I had to tell them to look because they both thought it was junk email  There has to be some way to let people know that it is really a gift card
__label__Negative	Brought card online as gift only to find out that another person redeemed the code  Took over a week to resolve and have account finally credited with the amount  Recommend you but gift cards from local merchant and not online
__label__Positive	Tops
__label__Positive	very convenient  and immediate acces really good

__label__Positive	He was very happy with it
__label__Positive	Nice way to give
__label__Positive	I wasnt sure about ordering this tin but when it arrived I was happy with it The cute design meant I didnt even have to wrap it What a great way to give a gift card My soninlaw loved it
__label__Positive	We were happy to be able to send our daughter and her husband a gift card over the web many of our children live in other parts of the country and it is a nice convience to be able to use this service We will continue to use Amazon Gift Cards Emails
__label__Positive	The packaging makes a nice presentation for a gift item

__label__Positive	Great way for my grandchildren to take their Dad out on his birthday
__label__Positive	Amazon made it easy for me to solve the the late Christmas present issue Knowing which restaurants  stores the prospective recipients favoured I sent 23 gift card per person
What I like best about amazon is that no fees were charged for electronic delivery
Compare to buying a gift certificate from a Mall or some outlets who charge up to 5
__label__Positive	I ordered a 500 as a group gift to our Book Club leader and then four 50 for family members  They LOVED the adorable little smile box
__label__Positive	Was given as a Fathers Day gift He seemed very happy with the card and in face has already placed an order using it

__label__Positive	box is nice this is gonna make a great gift
__label__Positive	Easiest gift ever
__label__Negative	When I printed them out they all had the same picture on them and a couple of people thought it was too difficult to purchase an item They had never gotten an Amazon Gift Card so they sent their gift back to me  So sad

The one amazon 50 card was returned to me because the person receiving it said she didnt understand the instructions of how to use it I read it  I dont understand either
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	It was a birthday present Im sure it was well spent
__label__Neutral	The colors were kind of dull and uninspired The message wasnt very long or all the lat great
__label__Positive	Perfect for holiday gift

__label__Neutral	A gift and you forgot the gift card

__label__Positive	Great card Used it yesterday
__label__Positive	I gave this as a gift to my friend who had recently gotten a kindle fire She loved it 
__label__Positive	The bartenders at my favorite bar are always getting Coffee Bean so I gave this to them as a gift It made them happy and they gave me a couple of free beers Everybody wins Except the owners of the bar I guess But they dont take of the place anyway so screw them
__label__Positive	Very Christmasee  made great gifts 4 my young Amazon enthusiasts family members that requested GCs  these were SO MUCH BETTER than sending the initial plain type cards I purchased  WAWA gas station of all places but they have an awfully Lg assort of GCs  lots ogood hot foodseven if I dont buy their gas  Also FREE shipping was offered so their was no excuse 4 sending the plainer cards esp since 1 could use said plain 1s 2 buy these nice 1s  send em directly 2 ur intended peeps

__label__Positive	very good food but a little noisey
__label__Positive	This was quite the steal  I saved 5 on the gift card by buying it through Amazon and my boyfriend and I went to the movies for Valentines day with it  By the way AMC Stubs members the 25 dollars WILL go towards your next reward  With that said well worth the purchase
__label__Positive	good

__label__Positive	Arrived quick easy to use
__label__Positive	Great Gift
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift cards for people in Alaska are the way to go  Amazon ships there when most companies wont
__label__Positive	I just love amazon This card was instantly available on my account
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	Very nice
__label__Positive	Whats to say its a gift
__label__Positive	It made my aunt smile as she remembered us singing this song sooooooooooo  long ago
__label__Positive	delivered quickly and worked as expected
__label__Positive	Ordered on a Friday night delivered on Monday one business day shipping as described  It would have been a nice extra for my message to be printed on the inside of the card rather than the packing slip  because I really dont see much point in a blank greeting card but other than that its a great last minute gift
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Really great gift card
__label__Positive	When you dont know what to get someonethis always fits

__label__Positive	Really cute tin that dressed up the gift
__label__Positive	Really cute tin for the gift card The person I gave it to commented on how nice it is And the best part  it was free
__label__Negative	Where is my 2000 Gift card Ad said buy a 10000 and get a 2000 never got the 2000
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Really first rate gift tags  I dont like giving a separate card so I just attach a tag to a package with a special wish  The tags are gorgeous  Victorian depictions of cats and dogs with just the right amount of glitter  The tin was a bit of a disappointment though  thats one massive label on the front so if you were planning to remove the sticker in the middle you cant  Also the tin is quite large and quite flat so the secondary use I had for it as a little keepsake box is not going to happen  The tags are large and of course arrive in great shape but I wont buy other assortments like this because I think the price should include a keepsake tin
__label__Positive	Quality gift card box  It was just what I wanted  He already used it to buy a food dehydrator  having great fun with it
__label__Positive	Great Whats not to like about a gift card And I like that it can be more fun than just a boring email
__label__Positive	Excelent
__label__Positive	Very quick and easy  Got to him almost immediately
__label__Positive	Amazing
__label__Positive	Marlis 3rd birthday was made when she received her gift certificate She and her mother spent a lot of time together deciding what to get and once the decision was made and sent in asking the mailman every day if he had brought her Amazon packages

__label__Positive	I love the gift card optionsespecially the ecard Its easy and fast And fun to send
__label__Positive	Package was delayed but I think it had more to do with weather The card packaging was bent though Thats why the rating is 45
__label__Negative	I think it is ridiculous that I had to put an extra 200 points towards this purchase which means Im really paying for the gift card instead of earning it with my 10000 points already accumulated When is free ever free anymore
__label__Positive	I love to bring a smile to my grand kids who live far away from me with a gift card from Amazon so they can shop for what they want  They love to look thru areas of the site they are interested in and pick exactly what they want

__label__Positive	Sending birthday gifts to the States has never been easierAmazon gift cards are always the correct size colour and get delivered on timewhat a time saver
__label__Positive	Everything worked as intended and the recipient a heavy Amazon user was delighted What more would you want or need
__label__Negative	Thought this was very flimsy Could almost open without trying the puzzle
__label__Negative	Looks very shabby
__label__Positive	Grand son loved this
__label__Positive	makes a great gift
__label__Neutral	but this one bordered on annoying However it was the only belated birthday one I could find
__label__Positive	Well packaged gift that looks really nice Perfect gift idea whether for birthdays or holidays I recommend this item to anyone
__label__Positive	Good gift
__label__Positive	I gave this to my friend on Christmas and found it hilarious to watch She thought it was a great gift idea considering that we live far away from each other to give it in person
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Bought this for my daughters 33rd birthday She and her husband have everything they want or need so gift giving for them is difficult She said she is going to use this gift card up on her Kindle reading list this summer

__label__Positive	This was not a 35 gift card  It is for 25  If it was supposed to be for 35 the sender should get a refund for the difference

I have not yet made a decision as to what to purchase with my gift card
__label__Positive	Love it
__label__Positive	A hit for the gamer in your family
__label__Positive	Gift that was well received
__label__Positive	Gave several of these as Christmas presents everyone loved it I heard lots of feedback on how much they enjoyed Cracker Barrel
__label__Positive	grateful parents of this gift
__label__Positive	I printed this gift card very easy to do and was done within a minute  I took it to my local Safeway and of course got a cashier who knew nothing about it The great thing is that the directions to the cashier on how to apply this gift card is printed along with the gift card I pointed to the directions on the paper she read it and had it applied within 30 seconds Not a big deal I saw several reviews where some Safeways arent accepting these and when I contacted Corporate I was told they have to accept them as long as they are valid Just because the people may not be familiar with printed egift cards it does not mean they shouldnt honor them We are in the electronic age they need to figure it out
__label__Negative	What is your problem with your gift cards and your ecards  Amazon  I purchased and sent my first yesterday they did not get them but I was charged I read over a hundred reviews of others having the same complaint and never getting any feedback from you Look at mine TODAY If not its your loss It was out of an Amazon credit card I just wont make ANY payments until you do
__label__Positive	Really easy way to send presents to a friend or relative in a different country Easy to use Safe secure way to send presents
__label__Negative	Gift card did not work says already redeemed  I lost 2500
__label__Positive	bien muchas gracias
__label__Positive	He always likes money its not paper so he hasnt used it yet go figure MEN
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Neutral	I like the card itself but I wish I were also notified if the person doesnt pick up the gift After a week or two I decided to check if the person had received the card and she said she hadnt perhaps she thought it was spam and didnt open it So I think there should be a setting that allows the buyer to specify a certain amount of time after which she will be notified that the gift has not been picked up I just dont like to keep track of more things than necessary I also hope that recipients of gift cards are send reminders to use them
__label__Positive	The person who received it was very happy and that made me very happy as well I was pleased with the ease of the transaction and the fact that the gift arrived on the specified day

Thanks

__label__Positive	quick delivery through email couldnt be better
__label__Positive	Just as advertised the gift card was delivered by email just about immediately  I sent it to a friend as a gift for introducing me to Diana Gabaldons Outlander series  As soon as I order it I called my friend to let her know to watch for it in her email  Just a minute into our conversation and she received it  Thank you Amazon

__label__Positive	Arrived quickly Easy way to gift someone when you dont know them well enough to get anything else
__label__Positive	It was a gift to a friend It worked  I mean it kept her in food at a difficult time in her life
__label__Negative	The gift card was bought as a present for my mother  who owns a kindle  unfotunately due to being in australia  the gift card was not able to be used on her kindle account

The purchase was attempted from the amazoncomau site  but there was no option to purchase a gift card  assuming amazon is one company  I purchased a gift card from amazoncom

It was extremely disappointed with the outcome of this as my mother was not able to purchase what she wished to kindle products

She also informed me that she was not given a choice about converting from amazoncom to amazoncomau for kindle purchases  considering this was the case you would expect to retain the same level of ability within the site being able to purchase gift cards very poor
__label__Positive	Thanks

__label__Positive	Very easy and very convenient  Makes shopping for teenagers less of a hassle  You never know what to get them
__label__Positive	Delivered on time can be customised easy for the recipient to use no hidden terms  whats not to like
__label__Positive	She liked it
__label__Positive	the only thing I dont like about the print at home gift cards is that it sometimes take a while before I get the message letting me actually print I make sure to order at least a day in advance rather than the day of
__label__Positive	Easy way to gift quickly The receiver loved it  The only down side though understandable is that I couldnt use my Amazon gift card to pay for it Try it youll like it
__label__Positive	Everyone I have given this to as gift has been delighted to receive  Great for a last minute gift  Its worked out great to be able to use the option of printing out the gift card and having an actual physical gift to give someone without even having to leave the house and stop at a store  Lots of great designs and occasions to pick from as well

__label__Positive	received card quickly and it was exactly as described Had no problems using it
__label__Positive	My son and his familiy were moving to the USA just after his birthday and clearly did not want to be lumbered with presents just before flying
I therefore choose a birthday gift card in US from amazoncom which I downloaded and was very satisfied with the service and the card which was much appreciated as he can choose something once they are settled in their new home
__label__Positive	I got it in a few minutes to my email
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	It so awesome how easy Amazon makes it to send a quick gift  A gift that allows the receiver to pick exactly what THEY would like  I sent gift card to my god daughter  She is going through a bit of rough patch and I thought a pickmeup would be just the thing  I have prime but when you order a gift card they rush ship and it usually arrives the next day depending what time of day you order

__label__Positive	my son loves to get these 
__label__Positive	It was quick and easy to send a gift
__label__Positive	Yum
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for someone who just got a Kindle and I hope that I get one for my birthday 
__label__Positive	Love buying gift cards from Amazon I dont have to worry about them being hacked
__label__Positive	My grandson thought it was awesome
__label__Positive	It was quick and easy and most people like birds and so one cant really go wrong with birds and Amazon eh

__label__Positive	Just fine
__label__Positive	I gave my 10 year old granddaughter one with my favorite toddler photo of her on it she loved it It was so much more fun for her to see than just a gift card  she knew I had taken extra time to think of her They live in a country where connecting isnt always the best so each communication with them is special This was a great idea Amazon

__label__Positive	it worked well
__label__Positive	Thank you for prompt service
__label__Positive	All perfect

__label__Positive	Using a pic of my daughter made for a nice card
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Negative	the gift card box from slip was from a random name rather than from me clearly a mistake when mailed this was a gift so it was very confusing to the recipient
__label__Positive	It was for 10000 birthday gift
__label__Positive	gift cards make everybody smile
__label__Positive	Great idea for wedding registry
__label__Positive	This was a welcome gift  Thanks for the wonderful giftgiving opportunity  My husband loved being able to pick his own gift
__label__Positive	Delivers to email recipient within minutes no fees and very easy to redeemsays recipient

Just like all other email egift cards on Amazon they are the easiest way to send a very late last minute literally giftto those located near or far
__label__Positive	Its a physical gift card Pretty much what you expect

I noticed the various card option may have some different restrictions to them as far as denomination but overall you can get any standard amount you would want

This card came in a bubble envelope for shipping then inside was my packing slip and a white envelope with text and barcode identifier for inventory purposes Then inside that card is the actual card with envelop for giving Im not sure if it would vary much if I marked it as a gift and sent directly to the person

The card is decent Not high quality not low quality
There is plenty of room for writing your own message inside either below the card or on the inner cover

There are instructions printed on the back of the card for redeeming the gift card online
There is also Amazon branding underneath the card
Personally I sort of wish that wasnt there so the card would be sleek and clean But that is just my preference
__label__Positive	Adorable gift card for a new mom who loves polka dots
__label__Positive	Great for gifts
__label__Positive	here is a gift that never stops giving most people enjoy shopping on amazon for books and songs now so this makes a great gift

__label__Positive	We havent seen this facility before and used it when sending our son a voucher Great surprise to him and thought it a great idea
__label__Positive	very happy
__label__Neutral	Its really convenient and easy to give to someone however you dont get any feedback saying theyve seen it or used it So unless youre in contact the recipient or get  thank you note youll never know if they got it
__label__Positive	Simply adorable Very attractive and a special baby gift
__label__Positive	Look good
__label__Positive	Its so easy to get a gift to anyone with these easy to buy and send gift cards
__label__Positive	The perfect gift to give to family members living abroad They loved the personal touch of the animated card too
__label__Negative	Gift message was not included

__label__Negative	Who thought you could go wrong buying a gift cardwell you can I have written a complaint to Fandango and I am waiting to hear back from them The bottom line is when I try to buy movie tickets online at their website at theaters they list you are told you can not buy tickets online at this time Makes no sense to me These GCs are like digital money You can not redeem at the box office The only way is online or by using their mobile app Now I have 50 worth that I am going to try to get my money back from I am going to lodge a complaint with Amazon also Not worth the aggravation

__label__Positive	I bought a 5000 gift card with an additional 1000 promotionfor myself Both were so easy to use It could not have been easier Thank you very much
__label__Positive	Pros This Gift Card  Greeting Card is very generic but an excellent value  Its made of moderate quality materials with vibrant colors

Cons Amazon has much better Gift Cards available some are actually include brand name Greeting Cards  This item is delivered in an envelope so the possibility exists that it can be delivered less than perfect

Quality Excellent
Value Excellent
Attention To Detail Good
__label__Positive	These gift cards are so convenient  cool
__label__Positive	Just as of ordered
__label__Positive	Great gift for Christmas or anytime

__label__Positive	Gift cards are always nice
__label__Positive	Ther eis so much hat one can buy through Amazon and so it makes it very easy to present this gift card
__label__Positive	El mejor obsequio
__label__Neutral	I wanted to use two nonamazon gift cards to make a partial payment towards a tablet and then have Amazon take the balance from my checking account  Amazon would not accept the split payment unless an Amazon gift card was used  I used the gift cards I had to purchase two amazon gift cards  Neither was delivered that day  The one for 15 came the next day  The one for 90 was rejected  I had heard that you sometimes have to leave a 1 if another gift card is being used to purchase the Amazon gift card so I tried it again for 89 and it went through Guess I have to use the remaining dollar at a parking meter or something
__label__Positive	perfect gift choice
__label__Positive	Easy
__label__Positive	I was too ill to leave the house to shop The printathome gift card kept me from feeling worse about not having a gift 
__label__Positive	just what I expected
__label__Positive	Excellent All good i love it And the deliver was good too i recomend it its cool and helpfull 
__label__Positive	Came very quickly and is a perfect gift
__label__Positive	I was just going to order a gift card for a friend but was nicely surprised when I saw that I could download one of my own pictures rather than using an Amazon standard Point you would need a photo printer as its sent to you by email and you print it yourself but if you do adding your personal touch to the card is a plus
__label__Positive	I purchased the gift card for my stepdaughter as I had bought her a new Kindle and she doesnt have a credit card or debit card to use for purchasing books  Process went smoothly and I am trying to convince her to get a debit card

Kind regards
Linda Wheatley
__label__Positive	Really upbeatloved it  Music is great  The animation is so cheery  This is a great card to send to a family member
__label__Positive	Amazing style
__label__Positive	I got these to hand out with homemade gifts this last Christmas  It adds a little something extra to the gift
__label__Positive	I have a hard time finding Christmas presents for my teenage granddaughter who doesnt live close to me She has a Kindle and loves to read so I give her  gift cards  for her birthday and Christmas It is the perfect present
__label__Positive	Husband loved it
__label__Positive	I am disappointed because I had included a message for this item on my order and it was not printed on the card This also is the case for another gift certificate I ordered in the Christmas Tree design
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt want an amazon gift card Its easy and quick for those last minute gifts I have bought many and never had a problem

__label__Positive	This is a great easy way to get someone who lives across the world a gift card So convenient and my sisterinlaw got to pick out something she really wanted 
__label__Negative	Amason charged me twice for one 4000 gift card I do admit that the card was beautfuland with promt delivery I just can not hookup with anyone to discussthis problem So THANKYOU for giving me another attempt at communacation
__label__Positive	The card was great for our Grandson living in the USA  the animation made my wife jump  so my grandson loved it 
__label__Positive	Great produc
__label__Positive	great buy
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	A gift box for the card is a very good idea  However it gets low marks on presentation  The bow barely holds on to the box due to loose threads  The card itself is covered with loose lint from the box lining  The bottom of the box looks wornscratched  Most people will probably not mind these minor issues and focus on the value of the card but I think the presentation could be improved somewhat
__label__Positive	the gift card arrived the next day was super easy to order and was practically easier to order it online than go to the nearest CVS to get it
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Easy way to shop for gift
__label__Positive	The picture came out clear and crisp no pixels Folding was easy and it worked out well

__label__Negative	Had a lot of trouble using the gift card customer service had to send me a new one in order for it to work
__label__Positive	perfect for whole foods shoppers
__label__Positive	You cannot go wrong with a Nordstrom gift card and I am so happy that Amazon was able to deliver it the same day
__label__Positive	it is so easy to do  I made personalize photo ones also
__label__Positive	Love applebees Just received this card in the mail Always have great food and drinks Will very much enjoy this
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card is so handy to give to anyone  Everyone can use it So easy to order always
__label__Positive	5 Stars
__label__Negative	I never got the promised 10 off on our next order
__label__Positive	What can I say When I give I give Amazon gift cards I have never heard a complaint ever I would never turn down an amazon Gift Card because I know I can use it on anything on amazon Perfect gift by email instant happiness 
__label__Positive	The card arrived earlier than expected It was a gift and my mother was pleased to receive it because she loves TGIFs French Onion soup She states it is the best soup ever

__label__Positive	I mean its a gift card it arrived and I am sure it will work
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and the snowflake tin was very nice1 less gift to wrap
__label__Positive	Gift cards are so  much better than having to shop all over town for a gift  I also love receiving them as I can buy what I like  Amazon offers easy shopping and a great selection
__label__Positive	Was very easy for recipient to use especially with the huge selection Amazon has to offer
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love a gift of going to the movies  Especially when they discount them
__label__Positive	Gift card is good but the sizes offered by the restaurants have been downsized immensely What used to be a large frosty is now smaller than a small drink at their competitionno longer a good valuewont be back or order a gift card from Wendys again in the future
__label__Positive	Recipient LOVED the container
__label__Positive	Perfect gift to give someone that lives in another state or city  Especially if they are an Amazon shopper  Will do it again many times  Also sent one for a family member in Australia

I have already told many friends about the certificate
__label__Positive	Our gift recipients are going to love these  Highly recommend these boxes for your Amazon gift cards  they add the perfect extra touch

__label__Positive	great deal
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	its so simple hasslefree and you dont have to worry about shipping
__label__Positive	anytime you give an amazon gift card its like money in the bank  you can buy anything that your heart desires
__label__Negative	I had such high hopes for this product My intent was to use  these as clever  packaging for holiday gifts for teachers and bus drivers etc but the quality control was so poor I returned the product From other reviews it looks like sometimes this product works out well so it may be a hit or miss item For me it was difficult to load and basically fell apart during the process This happened repeatedly not only with my loading but other people tried as well including people who have received and used such products by other makers in the past The consensus was poor product not user error The quality of plastic appears suitable for the task but it is not high end In our experience the springs fell out Because others have experienced positive results my recommendation would be to put your time and money elsewhere or proceed with the ole buyer beware caveat knowing this is sort of a gamble Who knows You may get a product from the production team that does a good job or even a great jobor not
__label__Positive	was a hit
__label__Positive	Very Convienent  fast for last minute gift  And they can buy what ever they want w all of the items amazon offers
__label__Positive	Its a gift card what could possibly go wrong Paid for 60 got 60
__label__Positive	One cannot beat the convenience of these Amazon gift cards We have given a couple of them out already this year The quality of the packaging is very good It beats a plain card for sure
__label__Positive	Went to the one in Irvine CA  Definitely a place to go once and awhile to splurge on you and the family  Good service but too fast pace  too many servers at once to be able to answers all at once  Feel overwhelmed  The meat was too salty for me You can ask for less salt or no salt meats just have to wait longer thats all
__label__Positive	Excellent I am very satisfied with the purchase
__label__Positive	Great way to send last minute gifts for any occasion Easy email delivery for those forgotten important dates
__label__Positive	it was great I know my friend will love it she will use it everyday on amazon kindle to read
__label__Positive	Could have bought locally but couldnt resist the jingle bells Nice touch
__label__Positive	I bought a lot of Amazon cards for Christmas and everyone like them  You can buy just about anything on Amazon  Its my favorite place to shop
__label__Positive	My son has 6 teachers and is in junior high  I remember when I started teaching 20 years ago getting little gifts from students  Not any more though  Students expected me to give them a gift  So being a junior high teacher I gave each of my sons teachers a gift card to Amazon  My son was amazed when he got hugs and thank yous from his teachers  I know the feeling of appriciation like that
I recomend this type of gift for your childrens teachers
__label__Neutral	A bit slow  didnt arrive until the next day
My previous order took 5 minutes as advertised
__label__Positive	Hard to beat a gift card as a birthday gift for a person in their late teens  She appreciated it
__label__Positive	I have used the amazon gift card for several years to to send gifts to family and friends around the world It is safe secure and convenient It makes my life so much easier

__label__Positive	I started learning how to play the piano with Marty over six years ago as a middleaged neophyte with no previous experience During that time I have gotten over any sense of self consciousness or embarrassment about my lack of musical knowledge or skills Marty has been completely accepting of my performance level wherever its been while always encouraging improvement  He seems to have an inexhaustible collection of exercises to help me overcome any difficulty Ive faced from getting the tempo correct to playing complex to me pieces  I have never worked with anyone who is so nonjudgmental and has such patience including myself

But thats not all  I enjoy all kinds of music and Marty works with me on really different genres ranging from classical to blues to bossa nova He tailors the pieces I learn to my tastes ability level and growing aspirations  Even though hes a professional and works with many professionals he makes learning even for a newbie great fun

__label__Positive	Saved me with a great personalized gift card at the last minute
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	The little gift box is cute and who doesnt need an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Hey its a gift card How many stars can you rate for cash equivalency the answer is 5 The reason is because your method for delivery is varied You can print at home send via email get a card deliveredAnd who doesnt like more cash except for that baby on the commercial And with a selection that is vast and covers the gambit from Apples to Zebrasits tough to go wrong with an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	What can one say about a gift card  Nice way to give someone a change to buy what the specifically want  I give these as gifts on a regular basis
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt want a gift card where you can have pretty much anything under the sun delivered to your door
__label__Positive	A great last minute gift 
__label__Positive	You cant beat an Amazon Gift card for versatility and ease of purchase not to mention ease of delivery

My only difficulty  I cant find a way to check if the gift has been redeemed when the recipients are slow on their thank yous  Not wanting to be intrusive with a family trying to get their feet on the ground now that they have a third child Im left trying to figure out if the gift email has been lost or not
__label__Positive	Convenient when needing to send a gift to someone in another state People love to be able to buy whatever they want from Amazon Much better than sending them yet another doodad to sit on their shelves It provides a certain sense of excitement to the recipient as they get involved in shopping for what they want
__label__Positive	Just a great and easy way to send a gift to our grandchildren
__label__Positive	I honestly never heard of this store until my son told me that my daughterinlaw loves it  I got her an egift card for her birthday  It was very nice hearing how happy it made her but purchasing what she wanted made an even bigger hit
__label__Positive	Really nice cheerful greeting card  Friend was thrilled
__label__Positive	Used it for items at the house
__label__Positive	Great gift for my grandson  Thank you
__label__Positive	I was on Amazon to purchase a book and saw a thumbnail to purchase a gift card  Since I had just bought a kindle for my son I thought a gift card would be perfect  I ordered it and he got the e mail  Ten minutes later I got an e mail from him telling me hed spent it already  It was awesome  I have told all my friends and family how easy it was
__label__Positive	good gift
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	I really liked the way I could customize my own gift card by uploading an image into it Very easy to use
__label__Positive	As advertized
__label__Positive	great deal
__label__Positive	The perfect gift for the person who has everything
__label__Positive	It was well liked
__label__Positive	Wish there were more cards like this one
__label__Positive	My son and his wife are going to New York soon and I wanted to get theme a gift for their anniversary  I love the them gift thing and Serendipity is her fav movie  I got the Ice Hot Chocolate Mix the Movie Serendipity and sound track and wanted a gift card they could use while in NY  Well low and behold I got an email from Amazoncom after ordering the other items that the gift card was available  I was going to call the restaurant  Needless to say it was a great gift and they will enjoy going there during their trip

Thanks Amazoncom for all the neat stuff you carry and thanks Serendipity for selling items on Amazoncom
__label__Positive	A1
__label__Positive	Great purchase Perfect for gifts It was nice to give away as gifts
__label__Positive	Works as listed
__label__Positive	Easy to use Had no problems
__label__Positive	Just what I needed and arrived very quickly cute packing
__label__Positive	It worked great was able to print the gift card the same day as the Birthday party that I was taking it too and the birthday girl loved getting it
__label__Positive	well this was a gift the person wanted so how can you go wrong after all it is a gift card
__label__Negative	The bow wasnt there while the card was fine pretty much you buy the gift card for presentation so they need a better design
__label__Positive	Great value it only  16 dollars
__label__Positive	I was stumped for a xmas gift  the recepient loves video games so this was the way to go
__label__Positive	This makes a terrific give  If you use Prime the free delivery makes the gift a winner
__label__Positive	The guess enjoyed the gift
__label__Positive	very handy for gifting my granddaughter books  this way I can search from her account and just buy free books and let her decide if she likes the free one enough to buy the others in a set  well actually like me she mostly likes to read  not everything  but pretty close  hahahhahahah  it certainly beats having my card connected to her account  she might buy a thousand plus LIKE ME
__label__Positive	Its a simple gift card but for no added charge it comes in a nice gift box  Its a reasonably solid gift box and the presentation makes the gift worth more than it actually does  With timely shipping and the added value of gift box it deserves 5 stars
__label__Positive	This is the easiest way to buy gift cards for sure It arrived fast and I like that they are already activated
__label__Positive	Came instantly to emailcan use in either store with no problems
__label__Positive	Very cute
__label__Positive	A great gift idea for a person that has everything
__label__Positive	GREAT
__label__Positive	The perfect gift
__label__Positive	Bought this as a gift
__label__Negative	I like the packaging  Very nice box and doesnt need any additional wrapping but
I gave it 2 stars because they do not identify the cards at all  I received 5 cards in one package for our family  Some cards have more value than others  There is no way to tell which one is which without opening the packaging pealing off the paper on each card to reveal the claim code  That should be the job of the person receiving the gift
Also because the purchaser did not check the Add a gift card box I have no idea who sent the cards and who is supposed to receive the cards  Even if she had added a receipt it still wouldnt say which one has what value on it
Amazon you should have the program automatically ask for the gift information  sender  receiver  amount on card  at the time the cards are ordered  That information should be attached to the outside of the packaging for each card
__label__Positive	A hit gift thats for sure
__label__Positive	Excellent  Better than I expected I have just gotten into it and love it I cant wait to really learn the features
__label__Positive	This was an excellent and quite fast way to get a gift card  If thats what you need  Without running all over town
__label__Negative	its a gift card big deal no discount nothing special
__label__Positive	This was the perfect gift The birthday girl loves amazon So she was able to get just what she wanted  
__label__Positive	I have sent many Amazon gift cards  All of my relatives are great distance away and they always seemed very pleased  I also send them to people who have everything and are hard to buy for  They buy what they want  I am so glad that Amazon provides this service
__label__Positive	Received the gift card within an hour My family enjoyed a meal at Appkebees that evening
__label__Positive	Sooo easy to give a birthday gift to someone  living away from me And they can choose the gift they want or need
__label__Positive	cute and short

She loves Amazon
__label__Positive	Good way to celebrate different occasions for your family and friends  Fast delivery and nice present
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Negative	Absolutely worst experience Ive ever had with a gift card I entered the code no less than 50 times on the site and it did not work I then ended up having to book my Airbnb without being able to use my giftcard I had already paid for and lost 25 Very Unhappy customer Will not recommend to friends
__label__Positive	These work well for what they are intended they were on time and to the right place
__label__Positive	Very happy and quick ship
__label__Positive	I loved the easy and convenient way to send a birthday cheer to my nephew  I know he buys on Amazon so I felt I could not get his gift wrong and I was right I got an immediate thank you

__label__Positive	Pretty card which says just enough
__label__Positive	This was a great last minute gift for an avid readercoworker The option of immediately printing it was a plus
__label__Negative	No stars Never got the gift card

__label__Positive	It was so easy since I live in another state from my children
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an Amazon gift card to choose your own gifts

__label__Positive	arrived fast and worked great on the website
__label__Positive	Shipped nicely packaged well and not bent Only downside is you cant purchase a specialty one like a birthday gift card

__label__Negative	Gift box was dirty and crushed inside Impossible to give as a gift and create the desired impression  This box says I dont care about you I am treating you like dirt  You people should be ashamed of yourselves  I wish I had listened to the other reviews  Instead I went with optimism that mine would arrive differently rather since this box seemed much prettier in the picture  Makes me really angry

__label__Positive	good
__label__Neutral	Though I appreciated the convenience of it I had to help my friend out a lot with this card She couldnt figure out how to activate it and it took us quite a while to find the access code You have to find a small button that really doesnt seem to have a connection to the card simply to activate it

__label__Negative	I am very unhappy with my gift card  the reason being I have been unable to use it  I have tried to purchase books on my Kindle but so far I have NOT been successful  I have been informed that I have a credit of 75  but it is of no use to me because I cannot use it  I appear to have a debit outstanding on my account which seems to be the cause unfortunately no one seems to have the intelligence to take it from the 75 credit Until this happens we are at stale mate  Pat White

__label__Negative	I have always had excellent experience with delivery of Amazon gift cardsthat is until this one  The gift card never reached the recipient  Not sure why  There doesnt seem to be a way for Amazon to verify receipt of the card and notify the sender if it didnt get delivered in a timely manner

In this case I was able to speak with my daughter about the gift card that was intended for her husbands birthday  This is how I found out that it wasnt received  Amazon cancelled the original one and I sent a new one to him  But this would not have happened if I didnt follow up to confirm that it was received

__label__Positive	It worked well for Fathers day present
__label__Positive	Worked as expected
__label__Negative	This was purchased for older people as xmas present  Whilst the gift card itself was fine the nature of their situation and lack of wless internet convenient to them meant that we had to activate it for them using our phones bluetooth wless  This meant even the example download of a couple of books to show them what to do cost us in excess of 150 for  50 gift card  Cheaper to buy them  a real book  Prob not relly Kindleamazon fault but trap for young players wont go down this road again
__label__Positive	gift

__label__Positive	I was wondering what to get someone special and thought that she would like to have this So I went on line and found what I was looking for and sent it to them

__label__Positive	Gift card
__label__Neutral	Product arrived on time but the gift note was not included with this birthday gift The recipient had no idea who it was from A bad slipup compared to Amazons usually reliable service
__label__Positive	Is it possible to send it againoriginal lost
__label__Positive	I purchased a gift card for my mother for her Birthday  She owns a Kindle Fire and loves shopping on Amazon

I uploaded a nice picture of me and sent it with a little Birthday message  She loved the picture and asked that I send her the actual digital pic so she could have it

Having no idea what to get her was going to get her a cool giftbasket I opted for this instead and she said she was very happy Id gotten her this she received quite a few giftbaskets already

Anyhow she was thrilled  And said thats all she wanted for her Birthday  I will use this in the future and highly recommend it as a gift for those who are on Amazon or not maybe they will start
__label__Positive	Its very convenient to send someone a gift card Theyre also convenient to use and Amazon is one of my favorite sites One of the cool things about Bing Rewards is that you can use it to earn 300 and 500 Amazon Gift Cards The Gift Cards are something I like to send  or get
__label__Positive	Who can go wrong with an Amazon gift card  This was a great gift for my father so he could choose the books he wanted to download  As parents get older they are harder to shop for and letting them choose what they want is a plus

__label__Positive	Excellent I am very satisfied with the purchase
__label__Positive	So easy to buy and I love the packaging
__label__Positive	I bought this gift certificate for my husband for Fathers Day  It was the perfect way to treat him and he spent it rather quickly on items he loved and had been wanting to buy but felt guilty spending money on
__label__Positive	Gift card came as described inside the perfect little gift box Looks great and fitted my needs
__label__Positive	These are great gifts to send to customers for participating in a marketing research survey It gives them the opportunity to choose a gift they want and it enhances participation
__label__Positive	After reading negative reviews I was a little hesitant about purchasing this gift card When I tried the code on my laptop it did not work and was listed as invalid just as some of the negative reviews were saying So to anyone freaking out like I did TRY IT ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE THE SEPHORA APP NOT COMPUTER BECAUSE THATS WHAT WORKED FOR ME My friend happened to suggest it and it worked

IT WORKS ON YOUR PHONE APP
__label__Positive	I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved the animation of the card It was beautiful Great design

__label__Positive	It was so easy  I do wish there were more graphics choices
__label__Positive	an incredibly efficient way to send a gift to someone who lives far away i gave this one to my godson as a graduation present so he could use it for college textbooks
__label__Positive	Gift card
__label__Positive	As described
__label__Negative	Card that arrived had a zero balance and showed that it had been used from 20132016

__label__Positive	Worked great Fun to be able to customize a gift card
__label__Positive	Easy and quick
__label__Positive	Great It was the perfect gift
__label__Negative	No where did it mention this in the description on the amazon page and it does not mention it anywhere on the lane bryant site You can only redeem 3 gift cards at a time I cant get into a store during open hours to take advantage of the free shipping to a store so I am nailed with 8 shipping on each order I purchased some cards myself and was given some by family as gifts There are more options out there now for curvy women to not have to put up with LBs shenanigans
I did see one or two other reviews mention this limitation but it was way too late for me If this isnt a problem for you great
I have made my last 3 orders from lame bryant
__label__Positive	This was a coworkers gift and it served its purpose perfectly Very convenient too since the recipient was getting married and registered on Amazoncom
__label__Positive	Love that you get this in 24 hours
__label__Positive	Love giving and receiving Amazon gift cards So easy and it even comes with a card
__label__Negative	I ordered two Christmas gift cards from the website purposely because they are supposed to come inside a card with a matching design on the gift card itself I felt that by doing this it would show the recipient that I had put some thought into this gift rather than picking up a plain Amazon card at the grocery store on a whim However what I received inside the greeting cards were NOT gift cards with cute pictures to match the card design they were instead the plain ugly black ones I couldve bought at Kroger after all I am very disappointed I feel like its false advertising or baitandswitch
__label__Positive	Money and a cute design  there is something for everyone on Amazon
__label__Positive	I think that its awesome that you can go onto the website and type in what youre looking for like the vouchers put in the amount you want then pay for it and print it off straight away
__label__Positive	Hey it was a real hit for my sisterinlaw She said it was comparable to cash She loved the Santa tin as well
__label__Positive	Worked like a charm Took me just a couple minutes to receive the gift certificate email Easy way to combine gift cards together at a different store
__label__Negative	Says 50 dollars got charged 5199 idk why  Plus shipping is free with items 49 dollars or more
__label__Positive	Great gift card  holder  Wish it had been for me
__label__Negative	Dont give amazon gift cards you can buy items the are on special
__label__Negative	These Amazon gift cards did arrive quickly but the free 1 day delivery actually took 2 full days to deliver No big deal I got my gift cards when I needed them and distributed the cards at a holiday party

Each card was supposed to have a personalized message for its intended recipient These greeting cards however were all BLANK While I did receive the itemized shipping invoice showing that each gift card had a different message printed on it The actual cards were blank

I like many others who have reviewed this service over the years have had this same issue If you intend to order any gift cards from ACI I would not rely on them to print the greeting card for you
__label__Positive	It was very nice
__label__Positive	Great gift easy to setup and easy to use
__label__Positive	They are fun and easy and you can get them in any amount I love them They have them for all events

__label__Positive	I have been giving Amazon gift cards for all kinds of occasions Receivers always find it useful and lot less stress for me
__label__Positive	This is a nice way to personalize your gift  I am also an advocate for the discontinued use of plastic which has created much waste and pollution in the world  With this gift no plastic or waste is involved

__label__Positive	Fantastic card I loved it and so did the recipient
__label__Positive	An Amazon gift card is so easy to buy and give  At Amazoncom click on gift card select amount of the card enter billing instructions pick the gift card image for the front print out card  Takes about the same time as it took me to write this unless you have a hard time deciding which cover to select because they all are so appealing

No if only they offered Chanukah and Festivus cards Id be all set

__label__Positive	These gift cards are the best thing going especially when youve searched and searched and running out of options and time Its even more fun for them if theyve never shopped with Amazon or online at all I remember my first online shopping experience its like having your own personal elf getting what you want and having it show up at your door or whoever you send it to many times before you expect it to have even left the store I love introducing people to Amazons website to enjoy a shopping spree its been my most reliable place to shop though sometimes appears limited when looking for a particularly good deal on a fairly common item even with sooo many items stores and other affiliates that sell on Amazon Loving Amazon Kindle store too

Negatives
 The gift voucher contains a lot of nonneeded text and could be nicer after folding It is GIFT voucher so the esthetics is somehow important
 When I wanted 2 vouchers with different graphics I had to make 2 buys or I didnt find other way how to get them
__label__Positive	This was a very smooth transaction  My daughter and her family are stationed overseas in Okinawa and a lot of companies wont ship there Also after shipping her some items I realized that the postage fees would mean that that I would not be able to spend very much on my grandchildren as I am on a fixed income It became clear that a gift card was the best option for me

Food was excellent in any case
__label__Positive	Worked great Used as a gift Friend was well pleased and it worked as expected
__label__Positive	Cant comment too much its a gift card Essentially cash
__label__Positive	Consider Put the package or box measures since many buyers are not from USA and we have difficulty calculating costs to other countries that in measures by volume also considered to be placed in another box for protection is that we make a volume exes and therefore we are greatly raises the costs

__label__Negative	Im glad I did not give this card away as a gift because I would be embarrassed to find out that it did not work for the recipient when it was supposed to Ive called the phone number on the back of the card and it is activated and contains the appropriate balance The card however did not read and was neither accepted or declined as the manager was telling me this

Ive gone to the company that operates the card and it referenced that any redemption issues should notify the retailer that issued the card So now I wait to find out how I can use my card with a balance but cannot be read and processed

__label__Positive	great gift for employees had the holidays  they really appreciate the ability to use for themselves or others right before Christmas
__label__Positive	A great value and great product
__label__Negative	I just tried to buy an iPod for my daughter with our gift cards from Christmas It turns out you can only use one gift card per order The call rep I spoke with acted like it was very generous that Amazon allows customers to combine both credit cards and gift cards in one order  She repeatedly sited security reasons as why I could only use one gift card at a time

Considering Amazon issued the gift cards AND my credit card I dont understand how they cant figure out security issues that would then allow me to actually use these things I wouldnt have thought Amazon would be so petty as to cause customers to make multiple orders on low cost items and force cash or credit payments for higher cost ones but that is obviously the case It is even more irritating that they sell gift cards for 100 but I couldnt use two at 25 I will definitely NOT be buying any more gift cards from Amazon
__label__Positive	Got this for my daughter and Im sure she had no complaints
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	It arived fast without any issues

__label__Negative	Warning amazon will not back these up in the event that gift card thieves redeem your card There are people who know how to get access to issued gift card numbers and redeem them I stocked up on amazon gift cards throughout the year for Christmas gifts I had saved up 12 100 gift cards and of the 12 3 were redeemed by thieves Amazon would go as far as to tell me the names of the people who redeemed them two were on Chinese accounts and one Im not sure Not me is whats important but they say they take no responsibility for stolen gift cards no help no reissue no nothing  If you look this is a common issue for many customers too Be wary of these gift cards if they are not redeemed within a short period of time they are very likely to be estolen Amazon if you can verify the card was redeemed to a fraudulent account you need to help your loyal customers out very disappointed in your lack of customer service in this regard

__label__Positive	When you live far away from loved ones this is a great way to get a last minute gift to them within minutes No more worrying about missing a special event
__label__Positive	These cards are an easy gift  You pick the amount of the gift card select the paper card you want to use and have it mailed to you or the recipient  I had it shipped to me so I cannot review notes not being on the card  I received them 2 days after placing the order  If you need an Amazon gift card more quickly you can always print at home or email the gift  They were a big hit with the recipient a college student who immediately had plans for it

__label__Positive	kids love it
__label__Positive	Always the perfect gift
__label__Positive	Love the gift cards with tins  Just an added plus to the look  Thank you Amazon
__label__Positive	The entire process was so convenient and easy  Within minutes Id purchased a gift with no worries about size color or usefulness  It was very much appreciated  The only negative thing I can say is that the email notification was delivered immediately and not on the date I had chosen oh well at least it wasnt late
__label__Positive	Easy purchase and process took only mins to gift
__label__Positive	always a good choice for gifts
__label__Positive	Delivered within 23 minutes to my email great last minute gift
__label__Positive	One word GREAT
__label__Positive	Just great service Cant ask for better
__label__Positive	So convenient Bought it for my brother who has a Cheesecake Factory in his area but the closest one to where I am is about 4 hours away This was a perfect last minute gift for him Its his favorite restaurant and I didnt have to drive 4 hours to get it
__label__Positive	It was just great
__label__Positive	no review is required
__label__Positive	nice and efficient
__label__Positive	Grandkids like being able to purchase stuff on amazon
__label__Positive	Arrived just a few days after ordering with just the standard shipping I am very satisfied
__label__Positive	Always a quality meal
__label__Positive	Easy Birthday gift
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are easy and much treasured gifts Im not a good planner and sometimes miss birthdays and occasions So Ive sent many Amazon gift cards as belated birthday gifts graduation gifts and even for an anniversary I send them through email so the recipient receives it more quickly I usually tell them its on its way Ive never heard a complaint
__label__Negative	I decided to take the lazy way out and order a gift card from this nonamazon owned company and I have definitely learned my lesson

To start out with a positive note however shipping was speedy

Now on to the not so good
1 The card did not come with an envelope like you would get at the restaurant so now I have to go buy one This eliminates any and all convenience that buying this item online
2 The card looks horrible Its logo looks like it took a round through the washing machine and lost I have a feeling the persons selling these cards reloaded them and then sent them out as you were buying them new I kind of took for granted that you were getting a new card however Im sure this is probably what happened in the end
3 I had to pay twoFREAKINGdollars for SH Like I said before had nothing else been wrong with the purchase this was stomachable fee as physically driving to the nearest Cracker Barrel and back would have not quite been 2 in gas but it saved time so I didnt mind it as much at the time had I gotten said envelope and the card was presentable

So in short I bought this item as a gift for my grandparents as they really like to eat at Cracker Barrel And now they get a card that looks like junk and I have to go out and spend a few more bucks on an envelope for it This 25 card very quickly just turned into a 30 purchase Unacceptable
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a gift card
__label__Positive	Exactly what the recipient wanted
__label__Positive	It dresses up a gift card a bit
__label__Positive	I really recommend it for those know how to buy from amazon
Many thanks
__label__Positive	What do you get a teenager for hisher birthday Hard right An Amazon EGift card is the answer You can choose the photo on the top of the card choose the amount enter the recipients email address and pay Now thats a gift and an email that anyone not only a teenager will love Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Bought this as a birthday card for a dear friend he loved it it was a great gift so quick
__label__Positive	Great for work
__label__Positive	Kash is king in my book
__label__Positive	Quick easy cute packaging
__label__Positive	This also was a gift and who wouldnt want a great gift card nicely packaged
__label__Positive	Nicely wrapped
__label__Positive	Great way to give a gift through Amazon
__label__Positive	The perfect gift for a 17 year old computer geeks  Easter Basket  Just the right size just the right shape and just the right color  Thank You
__label__Positive	As advertised
__label__Positive	Brought this gift card for my brothers anniversary present He loves amazon so it was perfect The card was cute too
__label__Positive	I dont know why you can rate a gift card I loved it Gamestop is awesome
__label__Positive	I buy gift cards for myself and as gifts I find they make super gifts for other readers  I like them for myself so I dont have so many little charges on checking account each month
__label__Neutral	Tin was bent when I got it
__label__Positive	Can never go wrong with a giftcard
__label__Positive	My grandaughter loved the extra cash to buy a Kindel Fire for her self at 8 years old she knows more than i do at operation the Kindel Fire Thanks
__label__Negative	not good
__label__Positive	This helped out quite a bit
__label__Positive	I never know what balls to buy shirt to get or what course to buy a gift card from for my Dad  I love the fact that you can use it for lessons also  My Dad certainly needs those but he keeps buying clubs instead  Thanks Go Play Golf for making it easy to shop for my Dad
__label__Positive	Kid having trouble picking out what he wants to get he complained to me there are so many choices  Definitely a winner for a teenager since they never seem to know what they want from minute to minute
__label__Positive	Amazon makes gift card giving so simple The old days people spend so much time and  picking out a card and write some good words on the card There must be some people who wished that they could erase and made changes to words on the card After that the card looked like scrap and got tossed Another card was purchased and the process started all over again When completed actual gift a check cash was then placed in the envelope to be delivered to that special someone 510 was spent on top of the gift I am avoiding all that hassle by sending Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Perfect as always
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	I think its kind of funny reviewing a gift card but what the heck Delivery was ontime the gift card was for the desired amount of money and the packaging was satisfactory actually mildly amusing stating something like exactly what you wanted which pertains since it was given as a gift hence the name gift card I digress Good card If you want a 25 dollar gift card for Amazon youve come to the right place
__label__Positive	No issues
__label__Positive	My favorite Rest
__label__Positive	It worked just like I thought it would Super fast and easy I loved being able to set my own amount and print at home 
__label__Positive	Its has a dog on it all you need
__label__Positive	great for giving
__label__Positive	Excelent service and very well received
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for my nephew  I like that it come in a tin instead of a box  In the grocery store you have to pay extra for a tin gift card holder so its nice that it is free and it came next day as promised  I coupled it with the snowflake tin to give to his sister
__label__Negative	so disappointed that I ordered gift cards for Business Group I work with alot of which they intended to use for Christmas Luncheon  Their supervisor had to pay for lunch and was treated as if cards were stolen  Even after they called Panera Corporate issue was not resolved  BAD BAD way to do business  Caused much embarrassment for me as well as the group that went to lunch
__label__Positive	easy transaction  worked great for a Christmas present
__label__Positive	As advertised  bought as gift well received
__label__Positive	Because this is always a reliable gift around the holidays birthdays or any other time you need to give something extra to the people in your life that mean something to you
__label__Positive	Thanks It did meet expectation The voucher size can be increased as it looked very tiny after print
__label__Positive	My brother loves Amazon and so do I So when I asked him what he wanted for his birthday it was no surprise that he wanted an Amazon Gift Card It was easy to buy easy to print easy to give as a gift Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Ideal gift and easy to get it done
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Positive	This item was very easy to use and was much better than waiting for a card through the mail or going to a store
__label__Neutral	I had a very difficult time sending this last gift card  I retried 4 times via web with no results  I had your rep do it with no results  Talked to another rep a few days later who finally fixed the problem  It shouldnt take 2 weeks to send a gift card
__label__Positive	Beautiful card I love it
__label__Positive	A friends daughter got married and I didnt have an address so I sent the gift card through Facebook I was a little leary but the process was easy and secure
__label__Positive	product came on time and as described
__label__Positive	Honestly I ordered a gift card because the box is so adorable
__label__Positive	Very easy to use
__label__Negative	Usually I am very satisfied with Amazon  I ordered a gift card to be sent to me to give as a gift I ordered a 50 card but received a 100 card with a gift note from some one I didnt know to some in LA Instead of just keeping the 100 card I decided to do the right thing and return it I called customer service spoke to some one right away but was put on hold three times with the same awful music At first he couldnt find my order although I could see it just fine After he scrolled half way down the screen viola there it was It was afterall  the second order rom the top Finally he cancelled the card I got and is sending me the correct one At least I hope so I was on the phone a total of 35 minutes most of that time on hold Worst ever Amazon experience
__label__Positive	The Amazon Gift Cards made giving gifts very easy especially to folks that are hard to buy for and its so convenient
__label__Positive	I LOVED the gift card printable  Will use it more often when possible
__label__Neutral	I like using the print at home vouchers The assisting lines in the pdf file fold along here however always create quite a mess they never fit where there I actually need to fold the card but a couple cm off This is because they are placed based on the letter paper size which is not used in Europe We use A4 with a different ratio in its dimensions Would be great to be able to specify in the checkout process what paper size Im gonna print on and get a corresponding pdf file
__label__Positive	I love being able to pick up a gift at the very last momentand long after stores have closed The designs are great too
__label__Positive	Great Christmas gift
__label__Positive	Ive always gotten great service from amazon  I will continue using them
__label__Negative	Found nowhere to voice my opinion on the unable to deliver status of my most recent order This is a business office and Ive received dozens of Amazon shipments here

What happened

Christine Cannon
__label__Positive	WOW  giftcards What could go wrong
__label__Positive	so easy and very happy 
__label__Positive	Love the print yourself gift cards Makes it so easy to give
__label__Positive	YUM
__label__Positive	They come with a really nice gift box and always bring smiles
__label__Positive	Gift Cards are fast easy and Amazon has great gift card designs  Using the card is easy and painless LOVE
__label__Positive	Who does not love gift cards  I love the printable version because I do not have to worry about getting it in the mail and it is instant
__label__Positive	Living in the UK and having grandchildren in the USA it is a perfect way for us to send gifts across the Atlantic  I recommend it to anyone
__label__Positive	Makes great gifts
__label__Positive	Daughter of COURSE loves this ha ha
__label__Positive	Perfect presentation for a birthday amazon card
__label__Positive	My grandsons thought the packaging was pretty neat and so did I
__label__Positive	A great last minute gift  when you dont know what to buy
__label__Positive	Mostly a good experience I sent a gift card to 2 people and for some reason neither received it I had to resend Thank fully it worked the second time but this seems to happen frequently Would like to see that fixed
__label__Positive	I bought this for my cousin for her birthday and it was delivered on the date requested as promised and she was delighted
__label__Positive	Its a gift card what can I say
__label__Positive	Quick easy efficient
__label__Positive	Cute Holiday boxes
__label__Positive	Received immediately very happy
__label__Positive	Great way to give a gift Especially to a confessed bookworm Easy to give from the comfort of your armchair
__label__Negative	I think the most upsetting thing is that you have no one that I could get in touch with to help me with this problem  This is the first time I used Amazon and I promise never to use it again  I am sure I have a password but could not remember same when I looked up my order  If it wasnt for my friend at Chase Bank in Phoenix I guess I would have just been ripped off  She contacted her main office and they were able to give me a credit

Dont worry about me anymore as I am not coming back  Clean up  your act
__label__Positive	It was pretty easy my daughter got hers in an email within a few minute
__label__Positive	The recipients should be writing this review  They were Christmas gifts for my granddoggies

__label__Positive	Its a gift card what more could you ask for
__label__Positive	Screw the pizza the hot wings are god
__label__Positive	Very nice
__label__Positive	This ten pack of 15 gift cards is great  The pack comes really quickly and can be used on anything Amazon  We keep a few of these on hand for last minute gift addons the 15 denomination allows for lots of gift giving flexibility  I even took one of the ten and bought something for myselfyou know just to make sure it workedIt did  
__label__Positive	Love Love Love this gift card box  Way FUN  Even better with what was inside  
__label__Positive	the presentation of card in box was outstanding  It made a gift card  look more like a real gift  Impressive
__label__Positive	Quick n easy
__label__Positive	I gave the gift card as a birthday gift to my son across the country No complaints
__label__Positive	purchased online gift card for a friends daughters graduation  Nice design and convenient  fast to purchase with short notice

The options for personalizing the card as well as the choice about the amount are quite reasonable

Only downside was that it took a bit of experimenting to find the correct setup for page orientation size etc in order to get the card to print out properly however this was not a huge annoyance just a bit of wasted paper and ink
__label__Positive	Free Greeting card How much more can you ask for
__label__Positive	as expected
__label__Positive	I gave this along with a Kindle kitchen stand to my mother for Christmas She absolutely loved it Now she can choose any Kindle cookbook or any other book that she wants
__label__Negative	checkout lady told us it would only work with a samsung phone That is just crazy Next time will order a real plastic gift card
my daughter was so embarrassed she started crying
__label__Negative	This is not the first time I have ordered a gift card that did not come in the amount I ordered  I ordered a 50 gift card but it came as and I was only charged for a 25 gift card  This happened on another card that I sent for my sons birthday  I will no longer order gift cards from Amazon  With a Visa gift card I at least know what I am giving
__label__Positive	These made perfect stocking stuffers over Christmas  Its the exact number of cards I needed
__label__Negative	Dont buy this if you live in a country outside the USA some items will not be available to you
__label__Positive	I like being able to get gift cards from Amazon this way  Easy to use and lots of card designs to choose from
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	THE FIRST SEND DIDNT GO THROUGH So I had it resent All good
__label__Positive	Vary satisfied
__label__Positive	I really truly absolutely love the ease with which I can send an Amazon gift card via email or facebook Just wish Amazon would not require a minimum amount of words to post a review  Really I could have said awesome The readers would have gotten the message
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Neutral	Garbage

__label__Positive	great easy christmas gift for neice who lives far away then they can get whatever they want you can track it too
__label__Negative	Am I missing something here Why would you pay more than face value for a gift card Does it come with a free gift
__label__Positive	gifting made easy

__label__Positive	NIce easy gift
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for anyone
__label__Positive	Not much to say Its a gift cardit came activated as expected and worked when we used it Easier than going to the store and buying one
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Sent one for each of the college kids who are fans of Amazon  Two were redeemed within daysthe third will use hers this week  I like how you can personalize them  send them instantly and check when they are redeemed  No doubt I will use them again
__label__Negative	The gift card is wrapped in a box but the box has a window on the back that shows a bar code so your family member can see that its a gift card when you open the box I wanted something for a family member who has a kindle but not many books for it and this didnt work as a present to unwrap
__label__Positive	I gave it as a gift
__label__Negative	I was disappointed because I couldnt use my Amazon gift card to buy it The card worked fine though I was just disappointed that I couldnt use a gift card to buy it
__label__Positive	Very well

__label__Positive	This is one of the best things to give to someone you know likes Amazon I give this gift card to my son for his birthday he was very happy with it
__label__Positive	Amazon didnt charge me any extra to buy it through them I paid 25 and got 25 It was quick and easy and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a Sephora EGift Card

Keep in mind that it isnt a physical card but a code emailed which is what I wanted but if you want a tangible card this isnt it
__label__Positive	Fast and easy
__label__Positive	This was a gift were the recipent can get what they desire and I would not have to worry about buyer remorse

__label__Positive	This frog gift ecard is a guaranteed smilemaker maybe even a chuckleinducer It is such a fun way to send an ordinary gift card to someone in an extraordinary way My recipient loved it The animation and the content were like wrapping paper Face it sometimes giving a gift card feels like a copout but add a cartoon frog and it becomes a thoughtful and creative expression of love that enhances the intent I hope someday this frog finds his way into my inbox
__label__Positive	My sister who received this gift was very exited and the surprise to get the gift card pop up was part of the fun
__label__Positive	Easy to use
__label__Positive	Use it today sent to me over week ago No expiration date Simale and follow directions good for gifts Always in your email
__label__Negative	CAUTION I purchased a 20000 Amazon Gift Card for Christmas for my son and had it sent to me so I could send it to him with a personal card and note The card was stolen in the mail and used by the thief likely a postal employee Amazon refused to replace the card or make a refund even though they know who illegally used the card Amazon places the activation code on the back of the card so that whoever has the card legitimately or illegitimately can use it

I also purchased Walmart gift cards to send to other relatives and had them sent to me so I could also send them with personal messages Walmart mailed the cards to me but emailed me the activation code One of these cards was also stolen in the mail at the same time the Amazon card was stolen however since the activation code was not on the card it could not be used by the thief Walmart replaced this stolen card free of charge and sent it directly to my intended recipient

Walmart does their gift cards properly Amazon does not Amazon will no longer be on my shopping list
__label__Positive	wonderful way to send a gift
__label__Positive	wicked pissah
__label__Positive	I have used Amazon to purchase many gift certificates Everyone loves a gift card Because the variety of ways to spend it the appeal meets so many needs Perfect for weddingsbirthdays
__label__Positive	Emailing my stepdaughter an Amazon Gift Voucher is a great way of giving her a present as I dont have to spend money on postage She can buy something she really wants and so far she has surprised me with the things she has chosen for herself as I simply wouldnt have thought of them
__label__Positive	Nice gift
__label__Negative	No way to customize
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with a gift card from Claires for a middle schooler

__label__Positive	I love sending Amazon gift cards through the email  I usually send 10 gift cards to just brighten my Mom or my Daughters day They find it in there email and the first thing they do is start scrolling for books to dwonload on their Kindles  I love to see their smiles and hear about the books they were able to get
__label__Positive	The process to order is so easy and it makes a great gift
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	This is a great way to send a last minute gift especially if the person lives out of town

__label__Negative	Received this item all scratched up Embarrassing to give to someone as a gift
__label__Positive	This would have been a 5 except that the processing of the card which was sent to folk in Mexico was difficult   they were unable to access it for some reason  But finally they did and liked the idea of picking out their needed gift for the new baby
__label__Positive	Easy to set up on line and print Wish they had a little more variety of choices of what the cards looks like
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for the ones you love
__label__Positive	This one is for that special person to enjoy the shopping
__label__Positive	Granddaughters enjoy having the opportunity to buy what they want  Amazon makes it very easy to
arrange
__label__Positive	Finally a gift I can safely transmit to my Australian family via email
__label__Positive	Nice gifts
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	It was simple easy and very convenient to purchase and print at home
Hassle free and quick Worked out perfect for the last minute gift
__label__Positive	easy to order neat gift idea
__label__Neutral	I wasnt thrilled with this and ended up returning it Its a neat concept but it was very difficult to get the ball in just the right position plus it had a little bug stuck in it I would not recommend this for kids gift cards for sure I do like the idea if only it were a bit more user friendly
__label__Positive	Everyone loves Amazon
__label__Positive	Ordered for a Christmas gift
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Neutral	Amazon gift cards neatly wrapped up in an Amazon gift box Fantastic idea But why is this option only available in denominations of 50 or more I would gladly pay an additional charge for the gift box for lower denominations but its not even an option Guess Ill have to buy a gift card and gift box in a retail store instead  how inconvenient Kind of defeats the purpose of online shopping Maybe theyll get this right in time for the holidays next year
__label__Positive	This is a great gift  Already packaged and ready to go  You get everything you need

Definitely a wonderful gift for Christmas time
__label__Positive	GOOD
__label__Positive	Great way to give a gift  I had no problem printing just deciding on WHICH card to use  I mean who can NOT like an amazoncom gift card
__label__Positive	These are great to have when your short of cash They also make great gifts
__label__Positive	Very beautiful card
__label__Positive	A great holiday deal from Amazon and this bear is no throwaway hes a premium stuffed animal from gund This year is the first year they have gone with a polar bear which I think works nicely for the holidays I gave it away to my niece and kept the gift card 
__label__Positive	Love the ease making purchases with Amazon Never had any problems in the past Thank you
__label__Positive	Great opportunity to get a gift card for less than face value
__label__Positive	Always welcome holiday gifts

__label__Negative	I chose the airplane card however when the template was downloaded and ready to print I got just the plain Amazon template not the plane as shown The description said it was the plane template  Very disappointing
__label__Positive	Site was user friendly  My son got received the card in a very timely manner  Easy from Start to finish Card allowed him to shop for what he needed
__label__Positive	Arrived on time  No problems  Good value
__label__Positive	We sent my step sister and her husband a gift card for Christmas  We ordered this card with the tin but ended up only sending the card

I kept the tin and am going to use for one of my DIY essential oil projects  The tin is really cute and who wouldnt be happy with an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	I bought this product for a friends Christmas present

I love that this comes in a box that looks like the Amazon boxes It is made of a thinker cardboard than then a regular box and has magnetic closures that keep the box closed The gift card is raised slightly in the box and it is held in place so it doesnt move all around Because the box is sturdy it was very easy to wrap and give as a present

I would definitely purchase again
__label__Positive	I love the ornament Tin Its perfect
__label__Positive	It came when it was promised
It was a gift to be used in Oregon and
I live in MN
Very handy
__label__Positive	What a cute way to give your gift card And you can reuse if you give to a family member
__label__Positive	Really like and enjoy these egift cards You dont have to print out most of them scan off your cell or if print out and misplace or lose Still in your cell
__label__Positive	LOL its a gift card  what kind of review do you want

The box was very pretty  its all nice and shrink wrapped

__label__Positive	Convenient timely
__label__Positive	Cute cute cute
__label__Positive	Appreciated being able to to provide funds to my grandson in his 20s so he can pick the gift of his choice from Amazons wide selection of merchandise  I used presentation paper to make the gift card and the colors were awesome
__label__Positive	Glad for the universal gift of Amazon and the packaging is attractive  Its perfect for the student in your life
__label__Positive	Always a good choicewhats better than being able to buy almost anything  It is super easy to add to your account also
__label__Positive	love he card  but was never received by the intended recepient
__label__Positive	It is easy  to give gift to other country
__label__Positive	Fantastic  ideal present kids could colour in and personalise and my daughter could choose her own books Huge fan of reading her kindle She was over the moon
__label__Positive	It was awesome We still laugh about it
__label__Positive	My friend appreciated the gift card
__label__Positive	excellent item
__label__Positive	what a great easy way for a gift wich can be almost anything brcause its amazon
__label__Positive	Enuf said
__label__Positive	Gift cards are the best Fun to customize
__label__Positive	This was a super easy gift for my nephew and got there fast with my Prime shipping
__label__Positive	Huge hit with the grandkids
__label__Positive	I personally love eating here and with these gift cards getting them  30 for 40 now that makes it even a better reason to visit more often  Got them on lightning deals so that being said time to get my Steak n Shake on
__label__Positive	It would have been nice to have a bigger range to choose from I think there is the potential for nicer cards
__label__Positive	My mother loves to download books from Amazon so an Amazon gift card was one of my Christmas surprises to her She absolutely loved it An Amazon gift card is one of the best and easiest presents you can give to an avid reader
__label__Positive	It was a gift for my son who lives many states away  There is so much to choose from and he can pick out what he wants
__label__Positive	I do not have one in Alabama but my Virginia family had a great time They enjoy this place tremendously and while I was visiting I got to go and it was so enjoyable
__label__Positive	I love Amazon I ordered a gift card as a birthday gift and forgot to put the recipients address I realized the next day after the gift card was mailed that I was going to receive it I quickly called Amazon and they cancelled the old one ordered a new one and the birthday girl woman received the card on her birthday That is why I love Amazon
__label__Positive	Nice way to send gifts
__label__Positive	The gift card was given as a gift They had no issues using it at the restaurant and enjoyed food I enjoy the  way amazon makes buying and sending a gift card in email for those last minute gifts easy
__label__Positive	I purchased this as a birthday gift  The recipient loved it  Everyone loves Amazon  I always ask for Amazon certificates from people  I wish my birthday was every month
__label__Positive	A practical and useful gift
__label__Positive	Cant beat a 50 gift card for 40 not to mention its 5 cash back with the Discover Card Great deal
__label__Positive	Convenient way to give Christmas gifts to friends and relatives who dont live near by and everyone loves to get them
__label__Positive	Highly recommend them are excellent salespeople Thank you
__label__Positive	Excellent Product 
__label__Positive	Fast
__label__Positive	excelente
__label__Positive	It was so easy to send this gift card as a gift with so many options that the receiver could use it for I would do this again anytime
__label__Positive	Love Amazon Gift Cards
__label__Negative	Amazon changed their egift card page again and it makes it increasingly MORE difficult to send gift cards to more than one person at a time I want to send to a group of people however when I click add to cart it takes me to the checkout page rather than staying on the egift card page and letting me add more gift cards to my cart

Amazon shouldnt you reduce the number of clicks if you want more people buying more gift cards The more hoops I need to jump through to add another to my cart decreases my chances of buying more Or for people who need to buy for a group will turn to another place to buy egift cards
__label__Positive	this worked out great being able to email a certificate I had trouble finding these cards in the stores so this made it easy
__label__Negative	The recipient had a very very hard time accessing the gift card number It was not intuitive even after we posting the gift card It would have been much easier to print and mail it
__label__Positive	Super innovative and easy but uses lots of ink
__label__Positive	excellant
__label__Positive	A great gift card for Amazon shoppers
__label__Positive	I ordered a gift card as a birthday gift and asked the recipient a few hours later to check his email for something from me He said he didnt have anything so I sent an email to customer service  I received a reply within 2 hours which was after midnight on a Saturday that a new card was issued and sent The following morning I woke up to a thank you text from the recipient Customer service rocks and took care of the glitch immediately I would definitely send another gift card via email and recommend it to a friend Im very pleased with how smoothly everything went
__label__Positive	This is to review the multiple gift cards purchased multiple times through Amazoncom  The purchasing process was a breeze and it was greatly appreciated that your website accepts international credit cards  The quick turnaround time on having the cards emailed was great  less than 24 hours from the time of purchase  Thank you
__label__Positive	great gift for my adult kids
__label__Positive	The perfect gift for a new parent
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always welcomed
__label__Positive	No problems
__label__Positive	Arrived in great condition
__label__Positive	This gift is great you can buy whatever you one It simple quickly and perfect I recommended everybody it 100
__label__Positive	excellent
__label__Positive	we tried to get a barnes  noble gift card for a book but they email it to you a few days later  This one is nearly instantaneously available  This is where we will buy future gift cards for sure
__label__Positive	It was easy and great
__label__Positive	I was a bit skeptical about this at first because the first reviewer had a really bad experience but I still decided to try and hope for the best
I was having issues using my Debit card on the sephora website apparently sephora doesnt accept payment from alot of countries
My total order was 300 so I decided to buy 3 100 sephora gift cards from amazon I cant buy the card on the sephora website either
I got 2 of my gift cards within 3 minutes and I got the 3rd one in about 2 hours amazon customer care said they needed to verify something
Anyhoo I divided my Sephora order into 3 shipments and I used my gift card They all worked perfectly without hassle
My Sephora orders have all been shipped yaay D
__label__Negative	Bought this as a gift for a wedding The box does not look as good as the image here Ended up buying a wedding card and put the gift card inside instead Disappointed with this purchase
__label__Negative	No This was someone who stole my 25 credit to buy the card Amazon replaced the money for me thankfully
__label__Positive	I ordered an amazon gift card for my son and he was notified via email so he could use it immediately These are a great gift idea especially for the person who is tough to buy for
__label__Positive	very easy and simple designs for the card I think you dont even need a printer  there is an option for emailing directly to the recipient
__label__Positive	A PLUS EXPERIENCE
__label__Positive	The box was so cute and made a gift card seem so much nicer  Well worth it The box made the gift
__label__Positive	This is definitely the way to go for people like me who dont like to shop I have sent Amazon cards for two years now and cant think of a better way to do Christmas
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Happy with purchase 
__label__Positive	It arrived on timeits a great present
__label__Positive	Getting a gift card took the guess work out of shopping and allowed my friend to get exactly what she wanted
__label__Positive	Bought it 20 off and will be pairing with a 10 off coupon

Came super fast and with the correct amount loaded and activated

I actually like the pretty metallic red of the card too
__label__Neutral	I love that these gift cards come with a card and I have ordered them in the past with no problem but my most recent card was printed badly The color was streaked across the front of the card and it smudged onto the envelope  Looks like it might be hit and miss with the card
__label__Positive	mjdg14com thanks
__label__Positive	I had to have the email gift card sent twice since she never received it the first time Other than that I like the email gift card There should be a way of being notified if the recipient received the gift card by email so that I wouldnt have had to ask her when I didnt receive a thank you from her All because she didnt get it the first time
__label__Neutral	The box is pretty Unfortunately the box also arrived dirty and stained It is not very dirty but it is enough that it was noticeable the moment I picked it up It looks sort of like sticker residue when you peel off a sticker and the stickiness stays If the box arrived clean it would be quite lovely As it is it is not very suitable for giftgiving
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Neutral	Just make sure  who you sent one to  is worth sending one to 
__label__Positive	This was perfect I was hesitant to buy due to the bad reviews but  I had no problems with the email link no with the store accepting it
__label__Positive	Perfect Immediately
__label__Positive	good purchase fast shipping
__label__Positive	Perfect for a long distance gift
__label__Positive	I sent my granddaughter this for her birthday Saved on wrapping and shipping
__label__Positive	Great but I got a 10 promotional discount on a future order and I cannot find it or figure out how to redeem it  It didnt come off my current order
__label__Positive	I forgot my nieces birthday until the actual daySo I got on Amazon and found this fun way to send a gift card  Shes 15 and loved it
__label__Positive	This is the second time I have purchased a gift card to send as a birthday gift  It was very well received and enjoyed by the recipients and was such a simple way to send a gift  dawoflvcom
__label__Positive	Hard to mess up gift card
__label__Positive	Whats better than an Amazon gift card An Amazon gift card in an adorable tin This is a really nice way to present gifts for teachers or endofyear tips or bonuses It arrived in lightning time too which is a benefit if youre like me and sometimes leave things for the last minute
__label__Positive	fast and easy
__label__Positive	Credit card gifts are easy and Amazon does it best
__label__Positive	tHE CARD WAS A GREAT GIFTthey enjoyed used Bought more bottles  for the  new Baby
__label__Positive	I got this for my daughters birthday What a great gift She loved it
__label__Positive	packaging was great  made the gift card extra special
__label__Positive	Very easy to access and always available
__label__Positive	Amazing
__label__Positive	Just as advertised
__label__Positive	Actually I had gotten phished off another gift card website and had to cancel my credit card as a result It was a huge relief I could buy the gift card through Amazon and trust that my sister would get it and my credit card wouldnt be compromised So yeah this was a MUCH better experience
__label__Positive	These are great if you need to order gift cards for a large group or need an incentive for customers Also bc these arent generic cards like VISA AMEX or MC there is no fee  Finally there is no shipping charge unless you need expedited delivery The only disadvantage is if you wish to buy a smaller number of cards as they come in packs of 50
__label__Positive	Makes the perfect gift
__label__Positive	who doesnt like amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	100
__label__Positive	There was no note in the package saying who it was from
__label__Positive	Just what the person wanted
__label__Positive	This is perfect for someone who is difficult to shop for Also great for people who love to shop online
__label__Positive	Great given as a gift
__label__Positive	Cash is cash
__label__Positive	Great Gift Thanks
__label__Positive	Great gift You can buy your tickets and or purchase snack from the concession stand I originally thought you could only buy movie tickets so I was very pleased to find out that we could buy snacks as well
__label__Positive	Cute way to give a gift card
__label__Positive	I love being able to personalize and print out these cards Especially great for last minute gifts
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	Always a winner
__label__Positive	Makes sending a gift in a card very easy
__label__Negative	I was given money by my mum to purchase a giftcard for xmas as her present I have purchased giftcards in the past with no issues This time however I chose the 60 amount expecting just that My account was later charged 74 due to the exchange rate or something Good thing i had extra money in my account or it would have been overdrawn and charged a fee Not too happy when i found out to say the least
__label__Positive	Love that you can use it at a variety of places  Had lunch at Maggianos and they gave us a dinner to take home for later
__label__Positive	Its a gift card not much to say
__label__Positive	Arrived the next day as promised Very pleased with the prewrapped box
__label__Positive	Gift card for whenever needed
__label__Positive	I purchased this gift voucher for a friend for Christmas Its easy to do and he loved the gift because he received a Kindle for Christmas
__label__Negative	Terrible  Frustrating and not worth one cent  Its not convenient or easier than going to the theater and using moneygasp or another credit card  RUN from this card
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with the grandkids and a 5000 gift card
__label__Positive	Gift for my granddaughter she like Justice cloths
__label__Positive	Love the convenience
__label__Neutral	I wish Amazon had a metal gift box for baby gift cards like they do for birthdays
__label__Positive	very cute and delivered within minutes
__label__Positive	Most of my grandchildren are growing so fast and their likes change as fast as they grow  The Amazon Gift Card is the perfect gift  They can use it to buy the music reading material or other things they might enjoy  Saves me time on shopping and I KNOW they will have what they like
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards make the best present  Theres something for everyone at Amazon  The only thing better than giving an Amazon gift card  is getting one
__label__Positive	A gift card is a wonderful way to allow the new parents to purchase whatever they need  Its easy to purchase and easy to redeem
__label__Neutral	Thanks

__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Great gift for a love one
__label__Positive	Worked like a charm
__label__Positive	Awesome 
__label__Positive	Whats better than a gift card Almost nothing Its like free cash Amazon offers so many items that their gift card is like cash You can find what ever you want or need and a gift card can help with the cost or cover the cost What a nice gift
__label__Positive	I put a pic of my son and his wife on the emailed card and mom liked the presentation of the emailas much as the gift itself
__label__Positive	Great last minute gift idea you can print from home and even personalize Plus you dont need to buy a card

__label__Neutral	I sent my friend a gift card for his birthday When I saw him I asked if he got it He said That was from you I was wondering who that was from

He showed me the email Amazon sent him with the gift card and my name did not appear anywhere
__label__Positive	Easy to purchase and great for someone traveling Thanks
__label__Positive	As a gift for my nephew one can always use a gift card and from Amazon it makes it easy to just sit and click the key to what he wants
__label__Positive	I loved

__label__Positive	works well
__label__Positive	This was great With my brother serving overseas it was easy to send this gift card to his Facebook and then he could shop and his gift will be waiting when he comes home
__label__Positive	Unlike gift cards that need to be redeemed at a store the card recipient can shop from home from a wide variety of merchandise
The card printed out beautifully  Again unlike the gift cards from department stores
__label__Positive	A very useful idea  What more can you say
__label__Positive	Great transaction and product

__label__Positive	Bought for my grand daughter she loves Sephora
__label__Positive	My friends had no issue using it
__label__Positive	My niece is a teenager  She loves to read but has read everything so buying her a book as a gift is not a great idea  A gift card from Amazon in a cool little tin box  Perfect  She loved it and spent it on stuff that she enjoyed
__label__Positive	This is the cutest gift card holder especially for someone who is a Prime addict
__label__Positive	Purchased for my niece to spend on clothing for my young greatnephew as he quickly outgrows his clothing
__label__Positive	Perfect last minute gift
__label__Positive	Very convenient
__label__Positive	What is there to review It was a Christmas gift that I gave away I guess I dont know what to write about this gift card
__label__Positive	The gift card showed up early  It was great
__label__Positive	A pregnant work colleague was flying back to Australia from England What to do with the whip round No room in her luggage for a pram or nappies 
An Amazon Baby Shower Gift Card solved the problem She can now choose what she likes when she needs it Good choice
__label__Positive	easy to retrieve and use
__label__Positive	Love the speed in which  we received the gift card  Looking forward to using  it
Thanks
__label__Positive	Received promptly and gave as gift  Personally I cant stand Cincinnati chili but what do I know  everyone else loves the stuff
__label__Positive	Good selection of card and was easy to buy and print Was well received
__label__Negative	I am usually skeptical about buying gift cards that are not directly from the company but when I saw this one was sold from Amazon itself I thought it should be a safe bet Boy was I wrong  I bought this card and it didnt work it kept saying that there was a problem with my payment I called Amazon they said they couldnt help because it was an Ulta gift card they just sell it  I call Ulta and they said that yes they are seeing the balance on the card but they dont know why it wont work Basically if you buy this card and it works great If you buy it and it doesnt work youre probably only going to get help from the neighbors  dog because Amazon cant help you and Ulta cant help you AND its nonrefundable Do yourself a favor buy a small denomination and test it first so if it doesnt work you dont lose that much Also dont give it as a gift
__label__Positive	So easy and the design options on the printable card were good
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	well all excellent  would recommend
__label__Positive	Very easy to find and easy to print  With so many gifts to choose from my daughter inlaw was very pleased

__label__Positive	I was in a bind and needed a fast gift for someone I did not know very well Being unable to run to the store at the time I did the printed Amazon gift card It was perfect and instant
__label__Positive	Getting any gift card is an OK gift for me as there are very few things that I need but occasunally something that I want the service via amazon wasis very prompt
__label__Positive	My daughter was thrilled with her birthday surprise Your gift cards are fabulous Thank you Amazon for making it so easy and she can buy the gifts that she really wants

__label__Positive	Got this as a Christmas gift and the recipient loved the box more than the card inside Its an amazon box that fits in the palm of your hand Theres a small magnet holding it closed so the flaps dont open on their own Very adorable and actually quite reusable for other things you might need a small box for Throw a diamond in there and really give em a shock Lots of possibilities
__label__Positive	Never reviewed a gift card before But I can promise you this its worth every penny and holds its value
__label__Positive	VERY PLEASANT TRANSACTION
__label__Positive	This gift card came in on time and is exactly what I wanted  Considering you can buy anything you want on here what could be better
__label__Positive	I love getting Amazon gift cards for people  Amazon has anything for anyone  I never know if someone likes certain stores so this makes it easier for some of the people I buy for that are out of town  They ship it right to the person  I did this one via facebook to my sisterinlaw
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	just what I needed
__label__Negative	No feedback on whether the card was receivedcashed
__label__Positive	lots of card options

__label__Positive	Easy to do and fast Had the card printed within 5 minutes
__label__Negative	Its a card for three months not 30 Do not buy for those who useget  a student discount
Ripoff I will leave Spotify because of this
__label__Negative	Although we checked and double checked the recipients email address to ensure it was indeed correct this gift card never did arrive in his inbox After  having him scour his junk mail trash can and spam folders there was still no sign after 2 weeks It seems odd that there was no delay in deducting the 50 from our checking account however It took a bit of digging but we did figure out how to resend the Gift Certificate and it arrived with no problem the second time around to exactly the same addressgo figure
__label__Positive	Loved the idea of putting my picture on the card It was easy
__label__Positive	excelente rapido seguro totalmente garantizado

__label__Positive	Para los venezolanos como anillo al dedo si no tienes en que comprar conviertes tu cupo electronico en tarjeta de regalo y en la cuenta pueden estar hasta que concigas en algo que quieras comprar simplemente perfecto Saludos
__label__Negative	Spafindercom is a huge ripoff  I received a 250 gift certificate but when I went to the spa there was a 4250 deduction from the 250 for a Spa Finder Commission  Just give your loved one a personal check or cash in a nice Hallmark card saying for a spa of your choice  at least then they can use the whole 250 and not get cheated  This company is a huge waste of money for the gift giver and a disappointmentfrustration to the user
__label__Negative	My mistake for not reading the description but whats the point of this if you cant use it to shop online I wanted to use it to buy a Harvard letterman jacket on the site I went in the store and asked if I could use the gift card order it themselves and have it sent to the store and they said they couldnt do that using a gift card Ok

__label__Positive	Nice but it wasnt pink and black like the photo it was the original yellow one
__label__Positive	great way to celebrate and easy to use
__label__Negative	Every time I order a gift card which has been twice  finally learned my lesson that is printable there is an error message and I have had to contact customer service at amazon which is not very user friendly  I will order an emailed gift card from now on or pick up an actual card at my nearest grocery store

__label__Positive	all good
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love a Starbucks gift card
__label__Positive	it was a gift for my granddaughtershe loved itloves Sephora
__label__Positive	I think is it useless to ask for review on Amazon card however the idea itself  possibility to get the card either in plastic later or electronic immediately  is wonderful and I buy thouse cards often for my friends and get them myself Since Amazon now sells everything it is very easy to find something to but with the card
__label__Positive	So handy
__label__Positive	when you send a gift card to someone usually they like it If the gift card is from Amazon even better
__label__Positive	grand daughter loved it as shes a dog lover wished there were more options to use for younger peoples sake
__label__Positive	Hard to find on the Amazon web site but once you find it it is just what you expect and the emailed card arrives promptly as promised
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt love this
__label__Positive	Loved my gift card because I adore shopping
__label__Positive	Guys  It will not be activated so just go to the counter of dominos and ask them to activate the card to you  do NOT open it  and theyll load the money for you
__label__Negative	So apparently its not true one day service If you promise one day deliver it in one day  Noone likes a gift AFTER their birthday So disappointed in you Amazon  Thanks for spoiling this birthday gift

__label__Positive	It came just as the card shown Bought it to keep it the car in case of emergencyyou know those I aint getting to work today days lol already used it so I guess Ill have to get another one
__label__Positive	Love the convenience  The prefab cards are goofy andor lame but I like the fact that you can at least upload your own  Would be great to get some funfunny cards in the loop  Also when you DO upload your own card image it would be nice if there were previewing and editing tools to alter the size of the image add greeting words etc

__label__Positive	Used as a secret Santa gift for a teacher  She loved it  The lump of coal picture really made the gift special
__label__Positive	It was exactly what I expected
__label__Positive	Awesome  packaging  Great gift idea
__label__Negative	The product was advertised with a 15 account credit with purchase Ive not received that credit
__label__Positive	I have bought iTunes 4 pack from this seller multiple times and never had an issue with them I love getting the 100 pack and getting to use them whenever i want i dont have to add them all at once if i choose not to
__label__Positive	Yes
__label__Negative	Bought a large amount on this boxed gift card for a friends wedding  and she called to say the link on the box leads back to the gift card sales page and she couldnt figure out how to activate the card  Apparently unlike oldfashioned Amazon cards this one does not have the redemption code printed instead you must come back to Amazoncom and activate the card separately  Does anyone know how my friend can activate this card
__label__Positive	The gift card is great its applebees that will get a bad rating if the food sucks
__label__Positive	This is a very nice way to send a gift without having to even get out of the chair Photos on the egift card itself make it more personal and the recipient receives them almost immediately Great buy
__label__Positive	I had been thinking about buying the 3G Kindle and the extra 25 Amazon gift card available with the 3G Kindle purchase was all it took to make up my mind  Of course I used the gift card toward the purchase of a cover for my new Kindle  Thanks Amazon

__label__Negative	The gift card was no received by the date it was promised No update until very late in the evening
__label__Positive	Amazon always delivers  Definitely cant go wrong with gift cards because Amazon has it all
__label__Neutral	Its good if you dont have to mail it I didnt think it through first before I purchased these Next time I will purchase the Amazon sent cards or the email sent cards if need to be sent away Lesson learned I guess
__label__Positive	No problems with it
__label__Positive	Excellent as always
__label__Positive	works like a charm
__label__Positive	The birthday boy was very pleased
__label__Positive	Its a gift card code that was emailed to me not much more I can say
__label__Positive	My gift amount was 20000 Was this just a typo
__label__Positive	Two Thumbs Up
__label__Positive	As I expexted
__label__Positive	The kids appreciate the gift cards That way they can buy what they want and need
__label__Positive	It was great
__label__Positive	gift loved it
__label__Positive	I like the simplicity of sending monetary Amazon gift cards electronically and the Amazon cards are always appreciated by the recipients
__label__Positive	did the job
__label__Positive	Perfecto Totalmente eficiente
__label__Positive	great store and always good to shop with gift cards
__label__Positive	It is a practical and efficient alternative to buying a present It gives the person the alternative to buy what best pleases himher
__label__Positive	The gift card came in a nice mini Amazon box that was magnetic  The card and the box were a hit
__label__Positive	The Santa Gift Box was greatit was so cute and a perfect way to present a gift card  The box was well made and made wrapping the gift card easy and made it possible to wrap it special

__label__Positive	Easy to gift
__label__Neutral	Just kind of mad that it could not be used for the purpose intendedI would have liked for the recipient to have been able to use it for Amazon Prime membership for 1 year
__label__Positive	This is very simple and perfect gift for a father I got it and liked the box that it came with
__label__Positive	I am very happy with the gift card i was able to send to my neice for her birthday She is a teenager and loves to get gift cards so she is able to go out and buy exactly what she wants The fact that i live on the other side of the country makes this a very easy decision for me especially since its gift wrapped

__label__Positive	Cute Tin Case
__label__Positive	Great way for recipient to get what they like and want
__label__Neutral	Dont buy this This is 60 where as you can buy one for only 50 No need to spend the extra ten dollars
Edit
After they changed the price it is back to the normal 50 still buy the other one since this one has to be shipped where as the other one is directly an email
__label__Positive	Amazon is the best
__label__Positive	This is amazon 2500 gift card in a blue and white metal cupcake really cute for a gift great price and delivery
__label__Positive	Gift ideas at the last minute
__label__Negative	I have not been able to access the account the gift cards were credited to therefore I do not know what product was purchased using the gift cards and I do not know what my account balance is Amazon needs to add a button or link so a customer can check the account balance of gift cards that have been redeemed
__label__Positive	I like that you can get it emailed to you and that you can use it instantly
__label__Positive	Such a great gift for the grand kids or anyone when you  are not sure what they would like and my being unable to get out and about always  They always like as they can select exactly what they want
__label__Negative	DO NOT BUY Complete scam My wife bought this for me at another retailer and I tried to use it at three different courses listed on their directory All three said they do not accept it and one of them had disappeared from their directory later that week Went back to the retailer to get a refund because go play golf said they are non refundable and the retailer doesnt give refunds on gift cards Even if it did work I have to call the course then call go play golf then call the course to confirm and hope they take it No thanks Now I ve been ripped off for 50 STAY AWAY
__label__Positive	I just love when I receive Amazon gift cards so whenever I get a chance I do the same for my friends and family

__label__Positive	These Boston Market gift cards are great You can use them at Boston Market If you buy a 25 gift card you can use it for 25 worth of rotisserie chicken and other stuff at Boston Market But you cant use it anywhere else because its only good at Boston Market lol
__label__Positive	Gift cards are perfect for Christmas giving  Beautiful card and envelope  Allow extra delivery time  Gift card was not delivered as promised but rather 2 days late

__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Arrived on time and just as described
__label__Positive	I dont know what you can say about a gift card pack Exactly as described The only way this could be better is if there were a discount for buying them at Amazon As always Amazon shipping was fast

__label__Positive	Easy and quick way to send presents no matter where you are My mom is an avid reader so the perfect gift

__label__Positive	My son and his wife loved it They are big AMC fans
__label__Positive	The best gift for a teenage son who has limited space in his dorm room for larger birthday gifts
__label__Positive	The card came in on time Not really much to say but got it via lighting deals and the card worked
__label__Positive	Its a very cute idea to make a gift card with a birthday motive such as this tasty cup cake that includes a wish 
__label__Positive	Fast delivery Nice tin

__label__Negative	Ive given gift cards before without any problem and overall I have been very impressed by Amazon Customer Service  This time they really dropped the ball  I ordered a 500 Gift Card for my children and grandchildren before Christmas in 2016  They informed me that the code did not work  They didnt want to bother me with it and tried unsuccessfully on numerous occasions to work it out with Amazon Customer Service  Finally after they told me about the issue I stepped in and Amazon acknowledged that the code was not working and asked if I wanted a replacement card or a refund  Since I dont trust them with a replacement card I asked for a refund which they said was fine and told me it went through  I asked them to send me a confirmation email which they said they had done  I told them it hadnt come in and they said they would send it again  I have now been on the phone with them for 35 minutesmost of the time on hold and still no confirmation email Finally after 36 minutes I did get a confirmation email stating that the credit would be applied to my credit card within 5 days
__label__Positive	Thank you for your beautiful presentation My mom loved this Beautiful package
__label__Negative	My daughterinlaw never received the gift card I purchased for her  I wasted 5000  The help desk told me she could pull it up from her email but she was never able to do that  Her Birthday was January 19 2012
__label__Neutral	There was a problem with using it Amazon Germanybut I think she finally got it figured out
Just got to figure out how to do it differently next time
__label__Positive	Amazon is 1
__label__Positive	A Birthday card customized to her liking  We created a dolphin theme with our own photo Thanks  It turned out great
__label__Positive	Easy fast and something everyone can use
__label__Positive	worked as discribed
__label__Positive	Whenever I need to buy a present for someone whos impossible to buy for I simply buy an Amazon gift card In the past I hated giving redeemable gifts it seemed so impersonal Not any more In nine out of ten cases when I ask family members or close friends what they most want for their birthdayor other special occasionthey say An Amazon gift card

__label__Positive	Super fast shipping I got it for a friends baby shower and she loved how cute the tin is
__label__Positive	My husbanda most generous soul gave me an Amazon Gift Card5000 I loved it I know some who say that giving gift cards require no time energy or thought I have to disagreegift cards are a most practical gift With it I was able to buy the books I had mentally set aside for down the road Nothing had to be returned because it was too big small wrong size or coloror because it wasnt my kind of book Thanks to my husband for letting me pick the things that I wanted

__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	You must say this is a gift in your order for them to put the gift card insidse a card and envelope no extra charge  Packaging it came in was insane  Huge box with cardboard inside to house 3 small gift cards  Waste of trees and cannot recycle cardboard where I live

__label__Positive	Excellent and FAST way to buy a gift Print out gift card at home and shopping done in minutes
__label__Positive	Can never go wrong with Amazon gift cards
__label__Negative	Absolutely Horrible The card comes with a claim code that has a sticker over it to conceal it and when removing it the last 3 or 4 digits could not be seen therefore I was unable to add it to my account Ive called 4 times and customer service said they were unable to verify it was a valid card going off of the fully legible serial numbers 5 Days and I still dont have the money in my account NOT RECOMMENDED

Helllloooooooooo Amazon
Amazon gift cards are the best  i welcome them
__label__Positive	very nice
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	Do not get deceived into buying a gift card thinking it is a kindle gift card especially if you live in Australia  The pictures of kindle gift cards next to the gift cards does not mean they are kindle gift cards they are regular gift cards that cant be used to purchase kindle books They are useless  After repeated emails back and forth to amazon customer service I was eventually refunded and told to get kindle gift cards on the Australian website  Which they do not have and believe me I looked  After repeated complaints to Amazon they eventually emailed me the best way to resolve this was to call them  I guess it is because they did not want to admit they were at fault in writing  A useless waste of my time and theirs Pathetic
__label__Positive	I gave this as a Christmas gift and the recipient was very happy to get it I knew he liked to shop at amazoncom so it was really a perfect gift

__label__Negative	my account was hacked and the money for this was stolen from me this money was meant to get my son the new car seat he desperately needs and now we cant even do that Warning to everyone watch out
__label__Positive	I ordered this gift card for a friend for Christmas It arrived in one day which was fantastic and was ready to go The card was in the box I requested complete with a bow and it was ready to go All I had to do was remove it from the shipping envelop and hand it to my friend It was wonderful Ill be buying many more gift cards in the future and will recommend them to everyone

__label__Positive	I love the variety of different e gift cards It was so simple and I was able to deliver the gift from the own comfort of my home
__label__Negative	You better read the fine print on this card before you purchase  You cannot use it on anything except 5 star full fare cruises  You will normally be better off just waiting until there is a good promotion or sale on  You will  end up paying more for your cruise if you book an eligible fare with this card than by booking a promotion or sale fare without it It is a gimmick not a bargain
__label__Positive	It was great for my nine year old granddaughter but I didnt realize my twelve year old granddaughter could not but clothing there anymore  The great side of this is she is  so sweet she said Nana I can buy accessories  They have really nice ones  She melts my heart

__label__Positive	So convenient and a timelife saver Nowadays everyone shops on amazon so this makes a great gift and plus the gift box is super cute

__label__Positive	Just as you might expect  a preloaded card for Netflix Great gift idea to introduce someone to video streaming services
__label__Positive	Perfect gift idea
__label__Positive	I cant believe how Amazon continually surprises me with more benefits to my prime membership I dont have to pay for online storage because Amazon has free Amazon Cloud to back up everything This membership not only provides Free Shipping but books all kinds of movies live streaming music downloads to my phone or tablet etc I felt bad that Amazon is taking over but I cant help myself with all the savings comparisons between companies pricing and conveniences  Thank you Amazon Thank you for sharing your wealth by giving us savings
__label__Positive	Nice quality stuffed animal  My niece who was gifted the bear commented on how soft it was  Considering that the bear was free with the face value GC and I purchased with a credit card that gave me 5 cash back this was a reasonable deal

__label__Positive	Very convenient to be able to buy my fatherinlaw the gift card he wanted without getting out of the house
__label__Positive	It is a gift card what do you need to know  This will not cure cancer it does not double as a light saber it wont give you the powers of Yoda  It isnt a drone that you can fly to amazon and use to deliver your purchase back to you  But it is made of a durable plastic and may withstand an explosive blast although the later is unconfirmed
__label__Positive	What an amazing company They are the greatest thing to ever happen to anyone ever
__label__Neutral	Fair enough for the price and use Fair trade eco friendly is a requirement and an expectation from coffee makers

__label__Positive	It was an instantaneous gift I purchased it with a birthday card for my daughter and she had received it before I had time to phone her to say I was sending it It enabled her to choose her own books for her holiday This was especially appreciated as her banking cards had been compromised and cancelled so she was unable to buy anything on Amazon until her new cards would have arrived a week later
__label__Positive	I love it easy to use and buy safely ideal for gifts on every occasion
__label__Positive	Make your life easier
__label__Negative	Pretty cheaply made One of the mazes I purchased you could just pull apart and not have to do that maze
__label__Positive	Great I got this in the same box that I ordered my xbox 360 elite in absolutely free This is the best deal that was on the internet Not even walmart newegg target or ebay could beat it
__label__Positive	Super easy to do  AND the recipient said SUPER EASY to add to his Amazon account  No paper  no fuss just FUN
__label__Positive	A fun way to present a useful and wellappreciated gift    that usually gets presented in a boring old card The box is adorable and made the gift special

__label__Positive	Husband is a fish guy and loves these for the aquarium supplies
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Although there was no discount on the 150 Amazon gift card the inclusion of the teddy bear made me buy it  The teddy bear is very nice quality super soft and very cute  It will make a great donation for a child shelter for Christmas
__label__Positive	The gift card has become the most attractive product when you do not know with what you may please eg young parents Instead of sending body in rose no 15 you shift the solution of your problem to recipient You are happy they are happy
__label__Positive	Great last second gift idea Code is accessible immediately There is tons of stuff on the Microsoft store that the recipient of the card can use to buy things with
__label__Positive	We love gift cards
__label__Negative	Had to get a manager to convert to plastic card Was way too much work on a weekend day  This was the El Dorado Hills location  The staff there is clueless  The female employee initially told me no it couldnt be done but when I demanded a manager she gave me the silent treatment After 20 minutes with the manager and a line of questioning why I wanted to convert to a plastic card I did some shopping there and 3 of the items I purchased were priced incorrectly upon checkout  I ended up leaving my basket at self checkout  Should have known better but will never use Safeway again
__label__Negative	did not order
__label__Positive	Ordered at the last minute and got on the 23rd  Thanks so much for the fast delivery and easy shopping  My kids all love amazon so its the best place to shop ever
__label__Positive	Wow was that easy  I had to make good on a gift in a hurry and in less than 2 minutes it was in the persons mailbox  Thanks for making my life easy and saving face
__label__Positive	what can I say  its Hoops and Yoyo

__label__Positive	It is so easy to create bill out and send a egift card  It saved me a bunch of time and money
__label__Positive	Nice for holiday
__label__Neutral	The card was delivered to the right person but I wish my name had been on it so they would have known who sent it 
__label__Positive	For the person who has everything this is the perfect gift Not only is the Amazon gift card very easy to redeem on Amazoncom the presentation box that the card comes in is distinctive and ideal for wrapping or not What I love about it most is it is THE PERFECT GIFT for Kindle users who love to read and appreciate the instant gratification of ordering a book then begin reading within seconds and the gift card alleviates the need to juggle creditdebit cards when ordering Ive ordered gift cards for adults and children since Amazon has something for everyone at affordable prices
__label__Positive	Gave this to my brother as a Christmas gift and he appreciated it because you can buy just about anything from Amazon
__label__Positive	great

__label__Positive	I love having the Olive Garden Gift Card I was able to use like cash and did not have to give upmy own personal credit card which was great
Easy to use
__label__Positive	Easy peasy for birthday gifts
__label__Negative	Ive never had trouble with an Amazon gift card before  Thought Id try the one with the photo  It was a gift for my husband for Fathers Day  Well he never received it  Everyone opened gifts at our family gathering and its a good thing I had printed out my receipt because that is what I had to give him  It never arrived  I emailed and never heard back  Finally after a few days I called and someone who was very nice and helpful said they would resend it  And they did immediately  Then the next day we received an email from my first email note saying they had cancelled the gift card and were sending a new one  Now we didnt know if the replaced email card was good  Very confusing  Finally straightened it all out but will never use this method again
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Worked without a problem
__label__Positive	This lasted less than a week of lunches for my son in law
__label__Negative	I got this card for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas We went to American Eagle so she could use her card When we went to check out the clerk ran the card and said there was no money on the card My daughter ended up putting everything back an dwas really upset

I call Amazon and I am told to call American Eagle I call American Eagle and they tell me that they cannot do anything about cards purchased through a third party I call back and they say it looks like the card was used It was not used by me or my daughter I then ask for a supervisor The supervisor ends up refunding the 5000 dollars back to my card

I will NEVER buy a gift card through Amazon again
__label__Positive	Excellent fast Love it So easy to get through your email Very happy customer Great service I would highly recommend to my friends
__label__Positive	Convenient to gift someone I got for my nephew who is amazon freak He is pleased that he can use it right away instead of going around to some shop or restaurant to specially use a gift card
__label__Positive	Bought it as a gift for my husband He loved it
__label__Positive	20 off Great deal
__label__Positive	Easy last minute gift
__label__Positive	Super fast free 1day shipping Nice gift option for Fathers Day or other eventcelebration The gift box has a brown woodgrain look with smokey blue band and gift card
__label__Positive	This pretty card makes the perfect gift for Christmas It is not too expensive but also looks appealing and festive
__label__Positive	love to eat at cracker barrel
__label__Positive	These were a cute idea but the people I gave them too didnt recognize them as gift cards They thought they were just tags and almost threw them away I had to tell them what they were
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Arrived on time and as displayed Given as a gift and was thoroughly enjoyed Always a good choice for a gift
__label__Positive	great gift idea
__label__Positive	just what we needed to thank our wonderful volunteer choir director for years of hard work and dedication to our church
__label__Positive	son in law loves the place and is grateful for the card
__label__Positive	The cupcake container for the gift card is great
__label__Positive	An Amazon Gift Card is a great way to send a gift or payment  Easy for the sender and well received by the receiver  I will use this again
__label__Positive	Great for gifts
__label__Positive	Ordered it and it was here by Monday  Great birthday gift  My aunt loved it and was able to pick out her own gift
__label__Positive	Came on time was just as expected what more can you ask for Oh yes maybe going back to no taxes but I know from experience that once taxes are in the picture they will never go away just UP Oh well what can you do like they say Death and Taxes are the only sure thing in life but Id love to get my hands on the person who keeps saying things like that
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	This was a Christmas present for a family grabpage  The recipient said they liked it but I cant be sure
__label__Positive	My granddaughter was ecstatic to receive this gift card on her birthday
__label__Positive	Always a favorite with nieces and nephews
__label__Positive	Works perfectly to gift the Amazon junkies for holidays
__label__Positive	Such ease ordering a gift card this way
__label__Negative	I bought this gift card cos I wanted to rent tv shows and movies but dont let me I dont understand that I can buy apps or kindle books and dont let me use the credit to but or rent tv shows or movies

__label__Positive	my 24 year old granddaughter loved it she was able to get just what she wanted and she loves shopping so this was the perfect gift
__label__Positive	It came fast  Just what I wanted
__label__Positive	Tried to cancel my order because of the negative reviews I read after purchase about the card not being activated My cancel request was denied but my card came activated and fully loaded Was a good purchase for a friend
__label__Positive	A nice format to present a gift card in and the personal message makes it unique
__label__Positive	Super easy Kids loved it and I didnt have to buy cards stamps or even make a special trip Perfect gift
__label__Positive	AWESOME I get just in time and she loves uses it to order books for her tablet
__label__Positive	who doesnt want to save an extra 10 bucks  will keep buying these as they come along  works great online when booking at a Regal cinema  Ive also used them for snacks and drinks
__label__Positive	She liked it Uses amazon frequently so it will come in handy Sure its already been redeemed Amazon has it all
__label__Positive	It made for a very nice and welcomed gift for a teenaged girl who received a Kindle for Christmas Nicely packaged
__label__Neutral	This review is directed towards Microsoft who really needs to get their act together regarding these gift cards  They have Windows Store cards and Xbox Store cards which are the exact same thing with different packaging  Unfortunately it is impossible to redeem this card in the Windows Store an Xbox game console is required  I called MS about this problem and their response was to use a different browser  How stupid can they get  Why in the hell would I install Chrome or Safari on my W10 computer to redeem a gift card for MS store  After being transferred several times the MS rep told me nothing could be done to resolve a problem with a card purchased from Amazon and put me on hold indefinitely  Id10t  I contacted Amazon who agreed to eat the 25 cost even though they purchased the item from MS  I went through the process of redeeming the card via my Xbox to assist the Amazon rep with troubleshooting the problem  MS should be aware of this problem and not treat their customers like dirt  Heres hoping that MS will see this review and fix this mess  Few customers would have taken the time to troubleshoot the problem
__label__Positive	I am so happy
__label__Positive	The cupcake gift card is very cute It will make a great gift
__label__Positive	excellent options for gifts to family friends couples and anyone who want to make a gift and not know exactly q buy
__label__Positive	Gift cards are a great way to give a gift and the people can then choose what they want to purchase
__label__Positive	Easy to get sent last min gift
__label__Positive	What cute packaging
__label__Positive	I received two Amazon gift cards at once two weeks ago and they are really great I was able to add them to my account and use them as I saw fit One of the items I bought had to be returned and Amazon got the amount I spent added back to my card immediately Its a great card to get as a gift or give as a gift
__label__Positive	Awsome She love her present
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	Christmas gift  Wellreceived by the recipient
__label__Positive	A perfect thank you gift
__label__Positive	This was a gift that was really aprpeciated
__label__Positive	Received the gift card as promised the next day However although I had requested and written a note none was included
__label__Positive	Nuce
__label__Positive	Always a perfect gift
__label__Positive	They are Starbucks Gift Cards  how can you not love that
__label__Positive	Love these cards I never have any problems using them
__label__Positive	I love shopping on Amazoncom  The orders are always delivered promptly and in good condition  The convenience is unsurpassed and the scope of products sold goes way beyond books  The outside vendors are very reliable  The only problem Ive had is that I ordered an item outside vendor that was In Stock but several days later was informed that there were none left  I was disappointed by that but that is the only time Ive been disappointed by an Amazon purchase
__label__Positive	EXELENT
__label__Positive	Always an excellent option for a gift especially long distance for an Amazon shopper freak Delivered on the day I requested and without a glitch its an easy option With so much available on here it gives a person so much to choose from
__label__Positive	the truth I have not had problems with the transactions except for those that are caused by shortcomings of bank balances
__label__Positive	Got here super fast  last minute gift  so yea that was nice
__label__Positive	square cornered and white as promised  Christmas driver related misdelivery of first card was replaced with a second  After the second was received days later we found the original hanging on our unused pasture gate  They simply said cut up the old which had been deactivated and keep the new  Eazy Peezy  Both were in pristine condition even after the first had been outside on our gate for days through a 12 snow storm
__label__Positive	Love it  My sisters bday gift and she knew just what she wanted cause she is an Amazon fan too
__label__Positive	Great way to get gift quick and easily and grandkids love Amazon
__label__Positive	Necessary for the transfer of funds in online purchase
A little picture some may find pleasant appears on its digital form
__label__Positive	Very nice idea for gifting a gift card  The tin looks great holds the card nicely  The tin was dented from the bottom pretty badly  This would be perfect if the material or packaging changed so that the tin doesnt dent so easily
__label__Positive	love my coffee
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	I got 10 gift card from Amazon for me to use and it was easy to send it on line

__label__Positive	Always fast easy and accurate Thank you
__label__Positive	This gift card arrived in an open envelope and it is a miracle that it wasnt stolen or fell out
__label__Neutral	I read many of the reviews here in an attempt to better understand how Spa Finder works I did this because when trying to redeem my Spa Finder gift cards that my mom sent me for my birthday my spa did not have a clear policy on what I could use them for and gave me a confusing explanation of how I could not use the gift card for discounted packages because I had received a discount when purchasing the gift card First my mom paid full price for the gift cards so there was no discount I had a long conversation with the owner and did some of my own research What I learned is that Spa Finder makes money by charging a commission to the spa on the redemption of cards In essence Spa Finder only reimburses the spa for a percentage of the card There is no discount to the client in purchasing the card so spas should be aware that just because Spa Finder does not reimburse them in full for the gift cards does not mean that client received a discount its not a coupon or a voucher Many of the reviews have advised to either just give the person money or a gift card directly from the spa to avoid these hassles I have a different take on this My mom lives across the country and she gave me these gift cards because it is more personal than sending a check or cash and it ensures that I will use it for its intended purpose She could not buy a card directly from the spa because of her location Whatever you think of Spa Finder as a company spas choose to participate in the Spa Finder program as a way of building their clientele It is a legitimate business decision and the price is the monthly fee the spas pay as well as the commissions on each card that is redeemed at their location While the fees may be higher this is a similar concept to the charges that credit card companies place on each transaction Regardless of the transaction charges business accept credit cards as convenience to customers so they can build their customer base Similarly spas participate in the Spa Finder program to build their clientele The Spa Finder program is not mandatory and spas know about the charges before they sign up I do not feel sorry for spas that choose to participate in this program so talk of supporting your local spa falls on deaf ears with me A spa is not a charity that needs my support It is a business just like any other and I expect the spas listed on the website to accept the cards as payment If the cost of participating in the Spa Finder program outweighs the benefits they should not participate Similarly it they no longer wish to participate they should remove their name from the Spa Finder website and place a notice on their own website that they no longer participate in the program Spas should really think about how participating in the program will affect their business rather than leaving it up to the client to wade through the technicalities I recommended to the owner of my spa that they add a section to their policy page explaining that because of the commissions they pay on the Spa Finder cards clients can redeem the cards only for fullpriced services and cannot apply the cards to discounted packages Spas can develop any policy that serves their business best but whatever the policy it should be clearly stated to the client upfront I gave this three stars because that means that its OK Not great not bad but OK I think it could be great but there are obviously some things to be worked out on Spa Finders part based on other reviews as well as that of businesses participating in the program Right now the potential loser in this situation is the client
__label__Positive	Great xmas gift

I received an Amazon Gift Card for Christmas from my son and his friend  It was a wonderful gift  At this point in my life there is not much that I need or want that is affordable as a gift Having the opportunity to choose what I desired allowed me to purchase books and other items that I wanted that no one would really know I desired

The metal packaging is a definite bonus for this purchase
much better than cheap paper packaging you buy from some local store
__label__Positive	What a fun way to give a gift  I got two of these for my twin daughters for a stocking stuffer for Christmas  Great packaging The girls actually kept the tin because they thought it was so pretty The card although it has no more money on it is still in the tin  As soon as they opened it they immediately ran to there computers and spent the 100 in under 15 minutes teenagers I hope they have these again next year so I can do this for my parents as well
__label__Positive	Netflix cards are hit especially when given as gifts  Amazon gets it here on time

__label__Neutral	Bought as a gift for my dad but should have read the small print about how to use the card as it was a little difficult since my dad is older  Good deal but cant use at some of the better courses
__label__Positive	The gift card was for my daughter and when she received it it did not say who it came from  I alsways thought there was a spot that I could have written her a short note
__label__Positive	Quick ship Nice card
__label__Positive	This Black Gift Card Box really adds to the presentation This really a nice touch offered by Amazon
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	I hadnt bought one before  I thought it would be hard and cumbersome  It was not I was pleasantly surprised at how fast and easy it turned out to be
__label__Positive	I got this particular gift card as a result of a seller that sells through Amazon not Amazon itself not sending an item I ordered to me They wouldnt even communicate with me despite multiple emails where I was trying to findout what happened Thankfully I was able to send an email to Amazon and they just gave me a gift card for the amount I had paid Im hoping they were able to get paid by the seller Happy as usual with my Amazon experience The card itself I will difinately use since I shop on Amazon so much
__label__Positive	It is amazing because there are so many places that you can use it I just love it and it is so convenient
__label__Positive	I loved the convenience of giving this gift its not the hug but a definite smile kind of gift I know my girl enjoyed it

__label__Negative	Did not include gift receipt or message Took 30 additional minutes to determine amount and recipient So disappointed
__label__Positive	great price and decorative

__label__Positive	Code get as soon I click pay
__label__Positive	When you dont have a clue what he wants or needs what better way to give a guy the gift of tools

Being able to print it out made it great for the lastminute gift that it was However a better layout for folding and presenting as proper Card would be nice Not sure if formats other than the one I chose might be better for that kind of thing

__label__Negative	I used this gift card at the Regal Cinemas on Broadway and they charged a Processing Fee per movie ticket purchased with the gift card Oddly enough they didnt charge a fee at the consession stand only for the movie tickets It was not a show opening or special event Even stranger is the fee less than 2 a ticket was allowed to be paid by credit card so the theater had to pay processing fee for the credit card transaction for their processing fee Ive used these gift cards in Virginia my home state and no fee was ever charged I guess its still a good deal but I think Regal shouldnt charge fees

__label__Positive	quick easy with no issues
__label__Positive	Cute gift box

__label__Positive	Gift for my sister Keeps her Happy up

__label__Neutral	Opened the card to find that its just made of coated paper Feels too cheap to give as a gift I mean its still worth 50 and I guess thats what really counts But at the end of the day this definitely would NOT hold up in my husbands wallet for an extended period of time and thats an issue

__label__Positive	Its a netflix gift card A gift card to netflix
__label__Positive	I really enjoyed using this service for a amazon gift card It is a great way to send a friend or family a gift card that is not in your local area or in your local area instead of using the postal service to send them a gift card  or give to them in person especially if you waited till the last minute to do so and it is quicker way for them to recieve the gift card The service was very easy to use you can choose from serveral different designs for gift cards and you can select what day of the month you want to send the gift card And you will get a confirmation that your gift card was sent to friend or family
__label__Negative	Thus far the gift card has been unusuablethe recipient of my gift of the kindle hd fire has been unable to download and purchase music using the kindle fire ap  she clicks on purchase  but then nothingtotally UNintuitivevery disappointing
__label__Positive	Easy gift for new home owners
__label__Positive	I have received an Amazon gift card for birthday and mothers day for several years  I love it  I am the usual grandma not this younge version that competes with their own kids in outdoor activities  I was a stayathome mother of three  and still is a stay at home type person  I belong to a book club and love to read  It is great to have all the books you need for your club reading paid for up front  I would recommend an Amazon Gift card to everyone that fits into that category  You can also buy anything you want besides books  I just bought a watch at 2am one moring when I was on the computer and not able to sleep  I love them and my kids can send me as many more as they would like
__label__Positive	A good way to save money for your baby when you need some extra time to make a decision of product selection You just lock the money so you dont spend it anywhere else
__label__Positive	Fast service and quality
__label__Positive	Dad was very happy with this and for a man who seems to have everything this is a good idea

__label__Positive	Too bad movies are too expensive
__label__Positive	Came in perfect condition
__label__Positive	Glad they have religious options for their Christmas gift cards
__label__Positive	I love the ease with which one purchases Amazon cards  My nieces and nephews live very far from me and it is so great to be able to sit down at the computer and within minutes purchase cards for each of them  Having the ability to send them via facebook and email is great
__label__Positive	ALL MY GRANDSON ASK FOR CHRISTMAS WAS A AMAZON GIFT CARD EASY GIFT I PURCHASED WISH THEY WERE ALL THAT EASY
__label__Positive	A gift for my goddaughterher favorite place to shop
__label__Positive	We received it yesterday thank you
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt like free shopping
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Loved it 
__label__Positive	Very fast delivery Worked fine 
__label__Positive	These Amazon gift cards that come with a blank greeting card are extremely convenient  They usually arrive in 2448 hours  I dont have to worry about buying a separate greeting card since Amazon has some really nice greeting card designs for all occasions  The greeting cards are blank on the inside but that doesnt bother me as I prefer to personalize my greeting cards anyway  I also like how many of the gift cards themselves have a design on them as well and that you can buy them in so many different denominations  If you buy them at the store they usually only come in the one design with the a on it and have only 3 or 4 limited denominations that they can be purchased in  Ive bought a couple of these for birthdays holidays and anniversaries  Most people I know buy something or another through Amazon

Another option I like when Im purchasing a last minute gift like on Christmas Eve is the option to purchase an Amazon gift card and have it emailed to you or the recipient  It isnt nearly as pretty but it is a very convenient option with instantaneous delivery which also allows you to purchase in various different denominations  Both the greeting card and email options also save you from the hassle of running to a retail store and waiting on a long line to buy one or two gift cards during the holiday season
__label__Negative	I gave a gift card to my son for Christmas and it has been a nightmare  He still hasnt been able to use it  All we get is excuses  Then they said it was accidentally locked and we had to wait for at least a week to use it  that was over a week ago  Today when I called the said they have to figure out what went wrong  In the meantime we waitmerry Christmas  This has been going on for about 2 months now
__label__Positive	Yummy yummy I got munchies in my tummy
__label__Positive	gift
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	I like to add an Amazon Gift Card to a gift or 2 for expecting parents  I figure there is always something they forgot hear about later or just dont get at the baby shower  Everyone is always ecstatic to get thisand even better yet  Heckmaybe the new parents can pamper themselves if they want
__label__Positive	Easy way to send a gift card
__label__Positive	Every one loves to receive money
__label__Positive	love the gift box
__label__Positive	Worked like a Charm
__label__Positive	Great gift idea
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	Loved them but gave all 4 as presents for Christmas Everyone seemed pleased
__label__Positive	Easy to order and send
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	The most convenient and flexible gift that you can give especially for those family and friends who live far away
__label__Positive	Gift cards dont lend themselves to review
__label__Positive	Fast delivery I loved it
__label__Neutral	Not a very attractive greeting card I recommend you just buy a regular gift card in the little box and get your own card
__label__Positive	The cute card added to the gift
__label__Positive	Just perfect
__label__Positive	Always easier to do  makes a great gift
__label__Positive	The box is very elegant We bought this with a 200 gift card but I think it would really jazz up a lowerdenomination card
__label__Positive	Worked great Fast and was fast delivery Definitely will be buying more in the future
__label__Negative	It may not be amazons fault More likely it is simply the mail system for the military posthowever my son never received his gift cardgreeting card I addressed this a few weeks ago and a second card was senthoweveR that card was not received either
At this point I believe a refund is in order We waited because of different activities at the post could have inhibited the delivery of mail but it has just been too long
__label__Positive	Always shop at Kohls  It has great sales and is close to wear I live  How can you go wrong with a gift card
__label__Positive	Nice fun birthday card Thoughtful and funny at the same time Recipient loved it
__label__Positive	I was very happy to receive this gift card in a timely manner and make a great gift Would do it again
__label__Positive	I really like the addition of printable gift cards makes it more classy    I am always pleased with the ease of securing gift gift certificates from Amazon
__label__Positive	Great gift for your self or a friend  Id recommend it over other gift cards because you can use it to find almost anything on Amazoncom
__label__Positive	Was great as a gift
__label__Neutral	I really liked the card design and colors When I printed and folded the card the backside was upside down Id rather have a 2 page card to fold both right side up The bride and groom must not have cared as I havent received a thank you note or other acknowledgement
__label__Positive	The package came quicker than I expected which is very nice  However I thought the packing is too big for a gift card  Luckily I have a pretty big mail box  The envelope is too big for a normal size mailbox
__label__Positive	I needed one last gift for my Son in Germany  This was so easy  There is no need for returning this gift
__label__Positive	I dont think there is anybody who wouldnt be happy with an Amazon Gift card  Instant and very useful  Great
__label__Positive	Very cute and colorful just perfect to hold a birthday gift card  It always brings a big smile to the face of the recipient
__label__Positive	She loved it Such a great way to send someone a gift
__label__Positive	Super cute
__label__Negative	Amazon is selling this card for a Charming Charlie card and personally told me it would work at Charming Charlie stores This card is not good for CCharlies I have notified the local storebut just make sure you get what you want Merry Christmas to all my Amazon peeps
__label__Positive	arrived cannot wait to go
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with an amazon gift card for most anyone  Also have a great selection to choose from
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are the greatest  I love to read so I use them to get books all the time
__label__Positive	Great gift The recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Sister loved it bought a Red Lobster gift card with it
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Arrived as stated Sent as birthday gift for a family member  Great way to send gifts directly to family and friends
__label__Positive	Great fun
__label__Neutral	I dont remember I get one
__label__Positive	Great idea by Amazon  Went over big during our annual Easter egg hunt
__label__Positive	Excellent process  Ordered from phone  Recipient of card loves it  Glad it was so easy to order Thanks a lot
__label__Positive	A gift
__label__Positive	So convenient Great quality card
__label__Positive	so easy to upload  print and its the perfect gift especially when you dont have time to buy a card
__label__Positive	great purchase for my nieces
__label__Negative	My son didnt get the ecard gift
__label__Positive	Bought this yesterday using 25 on debit card and 75 of existing Amazon gift card balance Shipped overnight Used to purchase tickets today Couldnt be happier
__label__Positive	The perfect gift idea when you have no idea what to get for  your teen aged grandson for his biorthday  No guessing no hassle just happiness
__label__Positive	Dont have to worry about size or taste but still know that recipient will get her hearts wish  the end
__label__Positive	This was an easy way to send relatives in Germany a gift that they could pick for themselves Very satisfied
__label__Positive	Nice to order them for Christmas The tin box it comes in makes it a nice gift
__label__Negative	Question Can this be used in Canada
__label__Positive	excelente
__label__Positive	Yes it was quick easy painless and it looked great  The recipient loved it too  I will definitely do this again
__label__Positive	Great present for your loved ones or for yourself  I love shopping at Amazon  com and look foreward to shopping more
__label__Negative	Was back ordered several times past the Easter Hoilday I ended up canceling the order
__label__Positive	There is nothing magical about a gift card  it is exactly you would expect
Instead of buying a bunch of books for holiday gifts in our family we make a handful of recommendations and then give a gift card to actually buy them This way we can avoid returning books that are not wanted no interest already read etc and it further allows the book to be purchased as either a physical item or as an electronic book via Kindle or really anything else on Amazon instead you could also buy an iTunes card with this and turn that around for books apps music or movies This makes the postholiday return issue go away all together

BTW this is an emailed gift card  the recipient will get a code in their inbox to redeem on Amazon Simple and nearly instantaneous
__label__Positive	These are funny uplifting little guys
__label__Positive	Easy to use great value
__label__Positive	I wanted to get a gift for my Grandson He was delighted that someone old could figure out how to order this online It was a snap
__label__Positive	very nice
__label__Positive	A

__label__Positive	Good little book My granddaughter loves it
__label__Positive	Soo nice
__label__Positive	No problems with this purchase
__label__Positive	love it gave one to my son and received gift cards the best way to shop and give gifts
__label__Positive	love the food there
__label__Negative	When the gift recipient attempted to use the card with Amazon they rejected it
__label__Positive	I like my free gift card pack that I got They are fillable gift cards This will make a nice gift
__label__Positive	It is not a very personal gift since you dont need to put much thought into it but in a very busy life it beats struggling to find something the recipient needswants and will use I personalize electronically and that shows effort Amazon continues to be ingenious
__label__Positive	Gift certificates to Amazon are the perfect present because these are literally millions of items that people can buy
__label__Positive	Awsome fo easy and super fast shipping

__label__Positive	The person receiving the gift card was very happy with it
__label__Positive	As always Amazon gift cards are great
__label__Positive	Satisfied  Cute message
__label__Neutral	My granddaughter is a Marine and getting packages to her is sometimes iffy so I decided to give her an Amazon gift card for her birthday she loves to read  I chose Facebook as the delivery method since she uses her cell phone for Facebook and I knew she would see it right away  The problem is that she had many many Happy Birthday Wishes posted on Facebook  When I didnt get a thanks for the gift card I suspected that she didnt even notice and that turned out to be the case  It is awkward to say By the way did you notice the gift I sent you but I did and sure enough she was unaware of the gift  In the future I dont think I will use Facebook as a delivery method for that reason
__label__Positive	IT IS SO NICE AND EASY TO PRINT A PRESENT IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT TO BUY SOMEONE PRINT A PRESENT

__label__Positive	My gift card has delivered on time
__label__Positive	Good deal
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are always a hit
__label__Positive	Always a good gift cant go wrong with a gift card
__label__Positive	Best thing ever
__label__Positive	My little brother cared more about the amount that was on it than the actual presentation but I liked it
__label__Positive	Great to keep around for last minute gifts Boxes are nice Gift cards could be better quality
__label__Positive	easy gift
__label__Positive	They were so engrossed in the card though that they missed the gift card so we had to go back and I reviewed it with them and helped them claim their card  Loved it
__label__Positive	Takes the guesswork out of getting your friends or family with Kindles exactly what they want Simple easy and lastminute friendly
__label__Positive	The Amazoncom gift card is such an easy gift to give You can even upload any picture and write a few words if you like as well The only downside is that it takes 510 minutes before you can actually print it If youre a last minute person Id suggesting giving yourself 30 minutes so you can print it and stick it in an envelope I was rushing and it was my fault as wellbut more on Amazon 

Enjoy
__label__Positive	great deal
__label__Positive	Super cute container
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love Dominos Pizza Got this gift card for my dad for Fathers Day
__label__Positive	Great way to say thankyou to special people
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	I like the fact I could print this gift card myself
__label__Positive	Everybody loves an Amazon gift card right Maybe not local merchants trying to make a living but I digress
__label__Positive	This was just the kind of gift card I was looking for the right color and beautifully designed
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are my gift of choice to receive  With it I get not only jet books for my Kindle but just about everything but the kitchen sink  Love mt gift cards
__label__Positive	Very beautiful card
__label__Positive	Love these animated cards  Perfect for birthday wishes for my remote nieces and nephews
__label__Positive	Envelope is really cute The size is 4 x 2  has a string so you can hang it or attach it to the top of a gift I ordered so I can give as a small gift attach to a gift as an extra or as a stocking stuffer I ordered the 10 card looks like 10 is the min but you can order higher denominations The gift card has the amount printed on the front The back of the envelope has a see thru window opening so you can see the bar code  2 blank lines you can use to write a message
__label__Positive	All good
__label__Positive	Came in very fast Very nice little box
__label__Neutral	Amazon e gift cards are good but they could be better  They get lost in the recipients email feed  Then you have to call them have them look for it That makes for a awkward situation  Just making the egift card stand out more by color or accents would help  And then maybe your doing this intentionally 
__label__Positive	Giftees liked
__label__Positive	Quick Delivery Wife Loves it
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	I recommend buying this as a gift for everyone you can find great stuff on amazon for very cheap It makes it easier for that special someone to buy what they want

__label__Positive	Delivered on time
__label__Positive	very well
__label__Positive	This is such a good idea for groups of employees as a gift
__label__Positive	It was a gift and saved me running around and shopping I know it will be used not stuck on a shelf or in a closet like some gifts

__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	everyone likes a gift card
__label__Positive	Just so cool
__label__Positive	I was going to send my daughter a gift card for her birthday and found where you can upload a pic in it What a great idea It was nice to add a personal touch to an otherwise standard gift card I loved the process and she had it in a matter of minutes delivered to her
__label__Negative	Not sure why I could not get it sent directly to my niece Instead had to buy and resend Boo
__label__Positive	Great teachers gift
__label__Positive	Nice gift to send to a friend in Italy where packages disappear between the post office and the mailbox
__label__Positive	10 off
__label__Negative	The card would be fine if delivered Ordered 9 days before Christmas shipped 7 days before Christmas still out for delivery 2 days after Christmas Next time Ill use email Problem is presumably w UPS rather than Amazon per se hence two stars rather than one but theres nothing else to this gift besides delivering the card
__label__Positive	Super convenient  Didnt have to leave the house and got the gift I needed  Perfect
__label__Neutral	Good
__label__Positive	great gift and the tin is very nice
__label__Positive	What can I say about a gift card
__label__Positive	Not a fan of gift cards for kids but my niece and nephew are getting harder and harder to buy for so this gives them the ability to get what they want Winner every time
__label__Neutral	Was a little confusing Not sure the picture did upload
__label__Positive	bought for a bday gift
__label__Positive	At first this was really confusing The email had told me I had to print it out even though one of the previous reviews stated they no longer had to be printed However I own an Android and it allowed my to save it to my Android pay app The cashier scanned the bar code via my app and it didnt register I went through the directions offered but they didnt seem help He started over and scanned it again and alas It went through Theres a few loops you have to jump through but ultimately it was worth it I will be repurchasing
__label__Positive	absolute genius to be able to email a gift card on the spot especially when you forgot to get a present Thanks so much Amazon
__label__Positive	By personalizing this giftcard you deliver to the recipient a way to choose from a pletoria of items in a format that shows that you put time and thought into the gift
__label__Negative	Gave this to my son for Christmashe tried using them today and they do not workworth no value Not happy Both were useless 7500 wasted
__label__Positive	Perfect Gift and my father loved it
__label__Positive	such an easy gift
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Easy to use Lots of choices
__label__Negative	Had problems getting the gift card to the person

Initially it was put in my account then when it was removed I put it in the wrong email address for the recipient and I was told I was unable to change it so she can use it with her Kindle setup

A bit of a disappointment for both of us
__label__Positive	First class very easy to order and an ideal gift option especially when ones loved ones are living abroad

I chose the happy birthday card and the gift card was attached to the inside of the birthday card  There was also room for me to write my own personal message and included another envelope to place and seal the birthday card inside of

Great product and overall am very satisfied  Got a better bargain than buying a gift card from grocery store or gas station because this came with a birthday card and envelope and was shipped for free via Amazon Prime
__label__Positive	Nice gift idea
__label__Positive	This was a great way to give an Amazon gift card for a birthday The tin was super cute and it was very durable
__label__Positive	awsome
__label__Positive	I wanted to get my mom a gift card because she reads on her Kindle Fire HD almost nonstop When I was younger she always told my brother and me that all she wanted for gifts were hugs and for us to color a picture This was a great little gift for her as I am an adult now and it was a little bit nostalgic
__label__Positive	Great deal cannot go wrong with a gift card
__label__Negative	Wife is a kindle fanatic and loves these gifts Makes gifting very easy and her response makes it a no brainier Problem is Ive purchased these gift cards twice this year and they never sent the email to the recipient Both times I had to go back and send the gift card to myself and forward them to my wife

__label__Positive	Love it It came in a pretty snowflake tin Great gift card presentation especially when its included for free Ive already recommended it to others
__label__Positive	The perfect birthday gift
__label__Positive	Great gift for the family
__label__Positive	I purchased two of these teddy bears and they are even cuter in person I spend a lot at Amazon so when I saw that I could get this bear with the purchase of a gift card I was pretty psyched They are not too big and not too small and their fur is sooo soft

My plan is to donate the bears along with some other toys for Christmas The bears are so cute I kind of want to keep one but kids will get more fun out of them Im sure theyll love them
__label__Positive	I like the idea of putting my own art work or photo on the gift cards I send to family and friends
__label__Negative	Recipient could not use the card  It did not go through and ended up paying for it herself  I will not use this again or suggest using gift cards by Amazon to friends  I followed instructions and tried to call to fix the problem but to no avail  But you got the money
__label__Positive	gift  easy
__label__Positive	This is the best way to shop for adult children by far No comparing what they got with each other and trying to see who got more spent on them no returns no disappointed recipients  Maybe my kids are just brats Lol But spending my time trying to find the perfect gift and then having it not liked appreciated or just returned always ruined the Christmas spirit for me
__label__Positive	Great gift idea the recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Its a gift card Its worth what I paid for it It has no activation fees or expiration date and it doesnt lose its value if not used Pretty much perfct as far as gift cards go
__label__Positive	Quick easy suitable for the occasion we wanted to celebrate
Flexible for the recipient on how to spend the voucher
__label__Neutral	I ordered two to get the discount and no it doesnt stick to my mariko mat maybe i need a certain mat i realized how can it stick when your doing all kinds of twisty poses and movements nothing will stick again no it does not stick
However the color i ordered is beautiful gray with purple trim and my mat is the same color as the trim so thats why three stars
Do i regret buying no i can use as a travel towel however i could have just bought one

And i again no it does not stick maybe if i get another mat it might do better or i should try the other side of towel if it sticks i will rewrite this review
__label__Positive	I got what I expected
__label__Positive	Great way to give a loved one a gift I also sometimes use them myself if I am trying to save to buy something from Amazon
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	It is a gift card  What isnt to love about it  I will definitely get brownie points for this one
__label__Positive	perfect Arrived in 2 days
__label__Negative	Nightmare Avoid at all costs Amazon and Wholefoods do not sell good gift cards online Major hassle lots of embarrassing situations
__label__Positive	Great experience  Never ordered gift cards before
__label__Positive	quick clear notification of a gift card waiting for me
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are the easiest gift to give Easy for me and the people receiving appreciate the gift
__label__Positive	Son liked it
__label__Positive	Very convenient
__label__Neutral	The cards printed well after I used the keyboard directions to print  The program did not respond to printing from the screen there were no direction to that would enable printing on the screen  However all was done on time in a satisfactory manner
__label__Positive	Ok
__label__Positive	Took 2 seconds to send Its adorable and who cant use an animated Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Once I got the right one it was great  the person I gave it to loved it  However the standard design prompt that was in small letters underneath the design I wanted was very misleading I wasnt sure what it meant  I clicked on it  I didnt realize that had changed my choice until I had already paid for it  Then I was unable to cancel it so I ended up having to buy a second card for the minimum amount 25 to get the design I wanted  That was why I ended up with two cards
__label__Positive	given as a gift person liked it
__label__Positive	How can you not be happy with a gift of20000 Amazon bucks
__label__Positive	Fast email delivery Comes with a PIN too Glad I didnt have to wait for these to arrive in the mail
__label__Positive	Supper easy Cute and great for gifts
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	So easy And always appreciated
__label__Positive	great present for my daughter she loved it
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	This was so easy to purchase and print The birthday kid can color it or if you buy it for your child to give he can color it 
__label__Positive	Great price
__label__Positive	Gift cards are the way to go When its my nieces and nephews birthday out of state they love getting a gift card from me  It gets emailed so fast and weve never had any issies
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Negative	I sent this gift card to my friend in England and he had a lot of trouble trying to access the site to redeem it  In fact he sent me one from the UK  which I tried to redeem to no avail I followed the correct steps which he relayed to me implicitly but it refused to accept the card number  I eventually had to send it back to him to cash in  Not very user friendly Im afraid
__label__Positive	Im glad you have a gift card you can personalize with your own images  Especially since my sister and I are quite close and I wanted her birthday to be special  I do a lot of nature photography and just happen to have photos she can relate to since both she and I have been to Shenandoah National Park and the local forest preserves  The gift card is quite well designed and I thank you
__label__Positive	I received an unexpected gift the day before Christmas so I panicked about how to reciprocateand it came to meAmazon Gift Card  they  will get in time for the holiday and can order anything they wantand it worked  They called immediately and thanked me and were so excited about some things they were thinking of getting  I also received a gift card which I will put towards my purchase of some new bedding that I had wanted  WinWin situation
__label__Positive	Love amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	Paid 20 for it as a gift When they tried to use it there was only 1366 on the card Very disappointing
__label__Positive	A good gift
__label__Positive	Went to the store to grab a gift card and that store no longer carried Amazon gift cards I did not have time to go to another store got online and ordered the ebirthday gift card and had it delivered on his birthday via email Thanks Amazon you saved me from having to say you gift will be late
__label__Positive	Very cute and was delivered intermediately This is a great way to send a notice for a gift of money
__label__Positive	Love the conviemce of this service
__label__Positive	I wish it was cheaper I dont want to pay 20 for 20

At least the glitter stays on the box or whatever you call it Though part of me wishes it didnt because then Id order this glitter bomb for someone I hate but dont want them to know I hate them Like Heres 20 meanwhile their hands are covered in glitter while theyre ordering their sex toys and ramen and Im in the background cackling maniacally
__label__Positive	Just as described
__label__Positive	Easy Quick What more do I need to say Amazon emails for you and they just accept
__label__Positive	The Christmas themed gift cards are an excellent way to send a Christmas gift to adult relatives who I will not see during the Christmas season because they live several hours away from me
__label__Positive	The tin is beautiful and it was a great way to give the gift card
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	This simple gift  card made a wonderful Christmas present for our youngest daughter 
__label__Positive	I buy these for my teenage nieces and nephews  You can send it instantly and I send it to their mom so I know it wont get lost That is a big plus Two of the three seemed to have no problems using the giftcard while one niece wasnt sure what she should buy  Still shell learn and Id rather have a giftcard that they cant lose bc their mom keeps track of the email and can put the value right on her Amazon account
__label__Negative	I figured I would try this gift card out In the order summary it said it will take about 5 minutes to deliver since its through email About a hr and a half later Im still waiting and just gave up and fed my children something else Dont think Ill be doing this again
__label__Positive	The perfect personalized gift for anyone you dont know what to get them Who doesnt love getting an Amazon gift card
__label__Negative	Amazoncom gift card was a gift request I am extremely disappointed This product should be easy to use Ie find desired products add to cart checkout like you would with a creditdebit card confirm purchase and wait for selected products to arrive by estimated delivery dates This gift card was not that easy or convenient to use You cannot go over the gift card amount and pay remaining amount with creditdebit card This increases the likelihood of not being able to use the full amount on the gift card When the gift card recipient attempted to use the remaining amount on the gift card after having made a previous purchase 10000 gift card 1st purchase 3000 7000 remaining on card Amazoncom stated This gift card has already been redeemed This is not accurate 7000 still remains on the gift card to be used for purchases I am embarrassed that the gift ended up being so difficult to usealmost to the point of being a burden I will not ever opt to give an Amazoncom gift card again I am reluctant to continue making purchases from Amazoncom after finding out that they use unscrupulous business practices such as the scenario I have described the gift card recipient experiencing I hope this review allows others to make a more informed decision before purchasing items or gift cards from Amazoncom to be used at Amazoncom Ultimately BUYER BEWARE read policiesrestrictions read the details of the purchase agreement and consider other methods of gift giving Thank you for taking the time to read this review
__label__Positive	This came in a pretty little holiday wrapper it was nice not to have to get an additional gift card box for it
__label__Positive	Its a gift card I didnt really like the box idea I thought it was an actual box Its just a flat card that the gift card slides up and down in Maybe it said that in the description but it wasnt quite what I had in mind
__label__Negative	Wanted to send a facebook video card so I spent about an hour going through things and uploading pictures of five family members only to have everything lost after one misplaced keystroke  Im not doing it again this sucks  Strongly suggest you avoid this feature unless they change things so that your work is saved along the way
__label__Positive	Thank heavens for Amazon Gift Cards  I hate shopping
__label__Negative	We bought a gift card for my FIL for xmas that was sent via email  Apparently someone else was able to redeem the gift card before he could  Amazon was able to tell us that they could tell it was redeemed by someone other than the intended recipient but they are unable to refund us  How does this happen  Very frustrating  I wont sent a gift card via email ever again
__label__Positive	What could possibly be wrong about an Amazon Gift card And what could be a quicker fix for that forgotten occasion than an emailed gift card even minutes before an occasion
__label__Positive	so easy to give gifts this way
__label__Positive	Always a great easy gift that is always appreciated
__label__Positive	Worked wellwe gave it as a gift
__label__Positive	Diet or no diet you can actually have your cakeof course the cute little cupcake gift card container isnt edible but the gift card was readily received by a dear frriend  The container is well made and I was very happy with it  Using the gift card on Amazon is a breeze

__label__Positive	Dont know anyone who doesnt like to shop on Amazon  Great gifts for any occasion 
__label__Positive	I go out to the movie theater a lot so I was pleased to find a great deal on Fandango gift cards through Amazon I make most of my purchases on Amazon and I love how smooth the transaction is This is an egift card and was delivered almost 5 minutes after placing the order I was able to use it on Fandango without paying extra fees to use it so I am not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about
__label__Positive	Large card with no envelope for mailing

__label__Positive	Thanks  It was a great gift for my mom
__label__Positive	We use Teladoc Telemedicine to use in situations where Urgent Care or Emergency Room just would have cost us to much money with a copay  This is the cheapest we have found for Telemedicine service  Interestingly enough we used for the first time when we were on vacation to San Diego and my child got sick and needed a breathing treatment  Worst case scenario happened we forgot her medicine It was 3am closest 247 Urgent Care was about 45 minutes away  We used Telemedicine and within 30 minutes had the Dr call us back  Prescription sent to the closest 247 Pharmacy and within an hour we were able to get my 2 year old daughter her medicine so she could breathe  Even though we have insurance  this was the fastest way to get the medication my daughter needed and there is no copay no driving to doctor and no wait time in the waiting room with other sick kids
__label__Positive	It was a funny and  animated gift which I loved
Other grandparents would love this type of surprize
Almost 68 years old
__label__Positive	A great way to send a birthday gift to someone who lives out of town
__label__Positive	brilliant
__label__Positive	All as Expected
__label__Positive	Smartly packaged and it arrived on time  This was a great gift
__label__Negative	You sent the gift card that we ordered for our Grandson to us  You had us as the shipping address and his address as the billing  Now we have to order a new one  We ordered 3 other gift cards with no problem  We are not happy
__label__Positive	A great way for a group of us to give a useful gift to a coworker who recently had a baby  This way the family an decide what they need most rather than having us guess most likely wrongly on what they might like
__label__Positive	Everything excelente
__label__Positive	It all went well
__label__Positive	What a great time I had online spending my Amazon Gift Card  Heres a pic of an anklet bracelet just one of many items I was able to purchase because of Amazons low prices and legendary service
__label__Positive	Ok
__label__Positive	I love tiny things and this just made my day  Bought a gift card for my husband then immediately stole the box for myself
__label__Positive	If its the last moment and you need something fast for a far away friend this always works  With the number of items available at Amazon there is never a problem for someone finding an item
__label__Positive	It was quick and it was easy I had no problems in either the purchase or in the printing process The theme for this birthday was cake and candles yep we do themes and I could not find the Amazon gift card with the candle in my local stores

Recommend
__label__Positive	great
__label__Negative	Very very disappointed that i received the yellow and black colored gift card rather than the pink and blacl I will not order gift cards from Amazon again

__label__Neutral	My mother just loves her Kindle and she truly enjoys receiving gift cards for Amazon When purchasing these cards in particular I paid for guaranteed shipping so she would receive it the day before mothers day She actually got it on the Tuesday afterIt was a waste of the extra shipping charges
__label__Positive	Requested as a gift  Received quickly and was spend right away  Love it when a teen will tell you what she wants  No disappointments
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	I used the gift cards while on vacation in Florida to avoid having to use cashgreat idea worth the purchase
__label__Positive	This was great to send a gift card to my mom for Mothers Day  She lives across the country and it is often difficult to buy gifts that she will use  With Amazon she is free to shop several departments and pick the perfect gift
__label__Positive	A gift card is the best gift in my opinion No one knows what you want better than you do so when friends and relatives get you some of these theyre giving you the possibilities

__label__Positive	Always a great gift for the Starbucks fan
__label__Positive	Great look for guys
__label__Positive	gift
__label__Positive	Amazon gift card was delivered instantaneously in my inbox once I made the payment Options were very customer friendly However since gift cards are for somebody else I would suggest to include an option to email the gift card to the person directly through amazon website instead of the purchaser downloading the gift card and emailing it to person I believe it is less hassle
__label__Neutral	It was ok not great
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	not much else to say it is a gift card and an open card so you can write your own message inside
__label__Positive	Came immediately
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	the process is very easy but more importantly the buyer is kept informed  about  when the gift voucher has arrived at the destination
__label__Positive	Perfect gift Fast delivery
__label__Positive	Always a great gift idea
__label__Positive	Straight forward  pick card pick amount and done Whats not to like Great for those who dont like to shop but want to give a gift that the person could really use

__label__Positive	Very convenient Perfect last minute gift
__label__Positive	Going forward I would be using them more often who wants to waste time on thinking what gift others would like what not etc Perfect Gift idea when you can not think of anything else Never goes wrong

__label__Positive	I am so glad to be able to purchase Amazon gift cards because they come in handy when I am uncertain about what to purchase for a friend or loved one
__label__Positive	What you see is what you get
__label__Positive	Printed out this gift card It turned out very nice personalizing the gift card with photos The recipient was surprised
__label__Positive	This was a gift and the recipient was very happy with it
__label__Positive	Just the gift I needed to send a friend without leaving my house
__label__Positive	I bought as many of these as I was allowed at Christmas because as they used to advertise and maybe still do youve GOTTA GET A GUND My son is autistic and when he was small no toy whatsoever could entertain him but rather a spec of dust could It was so frustrating because we didnt know he was autistic but definitely knew something back then it was 1 in 100000 that youd have a child with autism now its 1 in 50 In any case a young officer and his wife are in this fancy toy store one day and dad puts this Gund Polar Bear looked a lot like this guy in front of our sons face and suddenly our baby started laughing and giggling and reaching for it We knew we had to buy it but the price tag was quite high for this young couplebut of course we did Id never forgotten that momentthe very first toy he loved there were very few after that but were a few more Not sure where that fellow landed after all those moves but now hes part of our family again all dressed up in some red Im sure theres a grandchild in my future someday that may give all of us another round of loving laughter and giggling but perhaps without the autism but no matterthis fellow brings joy Hes so soft and adorable
__label__Positive	Another xmas gift
__label__Positive	Super pleased with this gift card  Bought this as a gift and it arrived quickly and in the proper denomination
__label__Positive	I got the thank you card and its pretty nice compared to the ones in the store There is no next in it when you get it so you will need to write something in it
__label__Positive	This was a gift and she loved it
__label__Positive	Had to give it anything less than 5 stars  I like there movie theaters and delivery as a gift was free
__label__Positive	Always a great buy for the child you just sent off to college or to avoid the long return line when trying to buy for your teenager
__label__Positive	Great option for a last minute present Arrived on the date as  promised You cant go wrong Would definitely purchase again
__label__Positive	The Amazoncom gift card worked out great  I was able to download a book I needed in very little time The whole process was easy to follow and nonproblematic
__label__Positive	As expected
__label__Positive	Heres why I am very pleased with this gift card
1 Floral design is bright and cheery
2 Despite an abundance of pink it is suitable for either feminine or masculine tastes
3 The outer envelope has identifying information and bar codes but could actually be mailed to someone who needs a gift card for someone else  That is not the actual envelope for the card so its okay to open it
4  Inside you find the greeting card with gift card and a standard white envelope for the greeting card
5  While so many greeting cards are specific to an occasiongreat auntinlaws third 59th birthdaythis card is a blank slate so you are in complete control of the message
__label__Positive	Gift Card
__label__Negative	The person I sent the gift card gets so much trash mail she assumed it was trash and dumped it in the trash  Please make the notice about the gift cards visible as GIFT CARD BEING SENT TO YOU
__label__Positive	Fast delivery on this gift card and easy to use
__label__Positive	You get what you paid for quick and easy if you are an AMC stub member it waives all the fandango convenience fees
__label__Positive	Received the exact gift card I purchased  No complaints
__label__Positive	The design of this card is fun and makes a good presentation as a birthday gift  I would order this style again  I was disappointed at the slower than usual delivery  Gift cards typically arrive within a day or two  This one was ordered on Tuesday and arrived on Saturday  Consequently it was not on hand to give to the recipient on his birthday
__label__Positive	excelent product
__label__Positive	Ease of use
__label__Positive	What you would expect works like any other gift card
__label__Positive	Expiring cash card from Amex Visa Discover or others Buy yourself an Amazon gift card and the dollars never go away You also dont need to keep track of the physical card
__label__Positive	Easy for the buyer and appreciated by the recipient  Darling choice of ecards available  I will choose this method of gifting again
__label__Positive	Cool
__label__Positive	Perfect

__label__Positive	It was so easy to make a gift card and either print and mail email print off and give personally so many ways  I will consider this way to give a gift for the future  I know people like the opportunity to be able to choose their own gift items and this is the perfect way to do it  Thanks Amazon

__label__Negative	This was a scam I bought this card as payment to a scammer and I now have no way to track it and report it to the cops 100 gone to an online scammer Please be aware that scammers nowadays are asking for iTunes  Amazon gift cards I am sad that Amazon does not allow these cards to be traced by who claims them Because of that I am officially done with Amazon Ive canceled my yearly prime membership and will never buy from Amazon again
__label__Negative	These are not normal gift cards where theyre as good as cash in their system I received THREE of these as a gift 90 I currently have a family account so Im unable to use them unless I cancel it and go back to having a standard one
__label__Positive	Texas Road House is one of the best Steak houses where you get your moneys worth and its so so good

__label__Neutral	Used  with card overcgarged
__label__Negative	I am so upset I ordered a 25 gift card from amazon I didnt get it This is the last time Ill be shopping on this site I tried contacting someone but it was trying to get me to pay them to figure out the answer and where my card is They said estimated time it would come to my email inbox was 15 minutes That was this morning Now its been a good six hours and nothing
I want my money back If anyone knows how to contact someone with this company let me know

Buy your gift card with caution
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card is a very good choice for someone recovering from surgery  They can use their recovery time to shop online which beats looking at wilting flowers any time
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love gift cards
__label__Positive	As advertised
__label__Positive	All good
__label__Negative	Of course its an Amazon Gift card and thats a Great Item to send as a gift  The 1 star rating is given to the way it was handled  My package was sent UPS Ground instead of overnight

to the amount if 50 isnt enough for something larger
__label__Positive	Very good product I would recommend it
__label__Positive	Amazon makes it very easy to send gift cards
__label__Neutral	This gift requested by my grandsons  Other gift certificates from other vendors arrived in a presentable gift box ready for gift wrapping  These arrived just as I would have taken them from a carousal in a grocery store  Not complaining just not impressed
__label__Negative	I bought this once before and it worked  The second time I bought it my nephew gets connected to a link that says cannot be used  I would like to have somebody at Amazon look into this but there are no options to get help  Sadly Im writing a poor review of it now in hopes that somebody at Amazon will see this and offer a solution
__label__Positive	The perfect gift  My friend loved it
__label__Positive	Worked on guitarcentercom
__label__Neutral	Easily added to your Starbucks account and transferred to your Gold Card  However it is shipped in an unnecessary padded envelope  I feel like I killed a polar bear with the greenhouse gas used to pack and ship this product  Unfortunately the emailed code version cannot be easily transferred to your gold card  It takes a phone call or a trip to Starbucks
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt love an Amazon gift card  It came pretty much ready to go  All you need to do is sign it and address it

__label__Negative	My mother said when she went to use the gift card today in Wichita Kansas that they told her all she had was 39 dollars on the card they said it had been used I dont believe Ive had this issue before is it the seller or is it fraud

__label__Positive	Which I didnt So is this phishing Is it a joke Is it a belated April Fools Day I give up
__label__Positive	I couldnt decide what to get my 30 yr old son for his birthday and this ended up being the perfect gift I loved that I could personalize it with pictures of him when he was little
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love Amazon Gift Cards Easy and convenient since I can print it from my printer A little trick I use nice decorative paper so it looks a little more fancy  And I like the choice of designs so you can really personalize it
__label__Positive	great servoce
__label__Positive	Your basic gift card but with a very nice presentation delivered in 2 days
__label__Positive	These were a great deal and I was able to use them as stocking stuffers
__label__Positive	Needs to get my dad a GC for the US We live in Canada so this was perfect
__label__Positive	I like the uniqueness this maze provides especially when it comes to giving gift cards I dont personally like giving a gift card because it seems so boring and jot very thoughtful This is a neat idea for giving gift cards that will be provide lots of laughs and fun trying to get the gift card out of it This isnt a super easy maze either so it is a gift for any age even adults because its not super easy even an adult will have to work at it This will be fun at white elephant gift exchanges also and will definitely get a laugh of out the receiver of the gift I like the cute snowman picture that is in the maze its a colorful picture that really makes this mazes appearance look much better and more Christmas like I think this is a really fun idea that will make gift exchanging much funnier and challenging This is a cute product for any age It is easy slide a gift card in but not so easy to get the ball correctly through the mazeHilarious I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review
__label__Positive	Product of an impressive quality and durability is excellent I recommend it
__label__Positive	Convenient even at last minute versatile use for recipients great choice of amounts easy checkout secure site used for years with no complaints

__label__Positive	Good last minute gift
__label__Positive	Love sending Amazon Egift cards
__label__Negative	You cannot activate the card Amazon will tell you to go to Wendyscom or the app but you cannot even get to where you need to go on the website Waste of money that you cannot get refunded
__label__Positive	gift  great
__label__Positive	great packaging
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	using it now
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	sweet

__label__Positive	all good
__label__Positive	Delightful way to send a birthday gift Very cute
__label__Positive	always a hit with my grandkids
__label__Positive	Well thought idea
__label__Positive	Seriously  Well it printed  It stated the amount of the gift on that print out

Then aliens attacked  They watch and learn  They are assimilating  If you notice someone using a Bic Cristal for Her and wearing a three wolf moon shirt walk away slowly  do NOT make eye contact  Their technology is far more advanced that ours but they have a soft spot for printable gift cards  They thought that a printable gift card for Amazon was nifty I do too
__label__Negative	Rip off
__label__Positive	Christmas gift for my daughter She was very happy
__label__Positive	The box was much nicer than I expected it to be Very happy 
__label__Positive	excellent transaction  a Gift
thanks
__label__Negative	DO NOT BUY THESE  People have figured out how to generate numbers for these and use your egift card before you do  Neither Amazon or TGIF will help you when you find out that your card has a 0 balance on it  I have made multiple calls to both and so far nothing
__label__Positive	I had the perfect gift in minutes
__label__Positive	Cracker Barrel what a fun place to eat get all your southern style cooking eggs in the Northeast such a wonderful thing lol but its a gift card so he might of money you put on it is the amount of money you get off of it it works it does well if you like Cracker Barrel use it if you dont I wouldnt bother getting it

__label__Positive	My niece and nephew enjoyed their night out
__label__Positive	Very pretty  Large enough to make a very attractive gift
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	How can you write a review on a gift card
__label__Positive	this gift card was exactly what I needed and specific for the occasion  Saved me much time instead of running around
__label__Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this item as I had been looking for one like it locally and there didnt seem to be anything available  It is heavier than I expected and the dual cutting edges come in handy  I would not hesitate to buy another item from this company
__label__Positive	OK
__label__Positive	Had no problem with it
__label__Positive	He loved it
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	It was the greatest
__label__Positive	Always a hit with the teens in our lives
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	Versatile and simple
__label__Positive	These Amzaon Gift Cards are the most AMAZING  AWESOME way to custom print your own occasion card and submit the amount you want to pay complete the payment trans and download it on your printer  Walla  You have now bought your occasion birthday card that you designed with your gift money number on the card  Fold it and send it  You didnt even havw to leave your house  This is TOTALLY the most AWESOME and convenient way to buy a card and present in onbe transact  Thank you AMAZON
__label__Positive	Gift card arrived next day as promised and in an attractive gift box with ribbon  Easy and speedy transaction  Recommend highly
__label__Neutral	Its quite OK but a bit childish tough It certainly stays up to what it was created but if its for an adult choose something else
__label__Positive	Well its a gift card Got it gifted it they used it Cant complain
__label__Negative	Terribleasked for my money back
__label__Positive	I often send an Amazon gift card to my out of town friends knowing they can choose from a long list of things and get just what they want
__label__Positive	I give and get gift certificates and like going to the store
__label__Positive	Fun idea for a gift card
__label__Positive	Granddaughters thought I was the bombweve already used one of them
__label__Positive	its a giftcard 
__label__Positive	Great gift for part of the grandkids graduation gift
__label__Negative	I gave this gift card as a Christmas gift  When the recipient went to use it the card had no value  I feel so embarrassed to have given a gift card that was worthless and frustrated that it cost me 50 for nothing
__label__Positive	This was wonderful for my granddaughter who was able to use it for her own gift from Amazoncom
It is hard to know at a distance what she would like so with the advice of her mom this was just the thing
__label__Positive	I love how quick and easy it is to get a gift certificate Great when you need something last minute
__label__Neutral	I was a little disappointed I could only send the gift card as email instead of an actual physical boxed gift card Would not deliver to New Zealand
__label__Positive	Gave as a surprise gift and my husband loved it He received it quickly
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Negative	I ordered the item and the delivery date was December 14 2012 This was ordered as a Christmas gift It is now December 29th and there has been no sign of this item Not only did it screw up my Christmas I am now out the 25 dollars I pain for this gift card and the 25 cash I had to give the person to make up for the fact that her gift never got here I am very upset and disappointed in this terrible service
__label__Positive	Always a good gift
__label__Positive	Cute
__label__Positive	Sometimes you give a gift that is returned the next day  You think its perfect but the recipient is going what were you thinking  This way you know your getting the right thing because the gift card buys what that person wants  Problem solved
__label__Positive	guft
__label__Negative	A bit disappointed  The greeting cards were not the ones shown in the ad but they still were thank you so I can live with that

The bigger problem was that they provided ENVELOPES THAT ARE SMALLER THAN THE GREETING CARDS  This makes the envelopes totally useless

Disappointing from amazon
__label__Positive	Very convenient way to shop I got the GC discounted and paired it whether some coupons SCORE
__label__Positive	Great for lastminute shopping and hard to buy for friends or cousins you havent seen in years  Available in any amount instant delivery and the option for Facebook delivery makes it easy if you dont have email addresses immediately available
__label__Positive	Worked great to buy food
__label__Positive	They worked what more to say
__label__Positive	LOVE
__label__Positive	What can you say other than good things  Perfect gift
__label__Negative	cannot be used without a USA account and credit card
__label__Positive	When you have someone whos got everything they need the best gift I can think of is a gift card And a gift card that is literally good for everything is Amazons
__label__Positive	met my expectations
__label__Positive	Very pretty packaging
__label__Positive	Received the gift card in great shape Thanks
__label__Positive	the convenience of printing at home was great but still not as good as the gift cards that I already paid for that were supposed to be here Christmas eve
__label__Positive	This was fast easy  and very convenient  Some of my family lives out of state and I tend to wait until off  the last minute  to send out gift and greeting cards  And whats great is that is my whole family likes to buy on amazoncom I only wish they would have more ecards there are for daughters  sons  mothers sisters brothers etc
__label__Negative	I bought a 25 gift voucher as a Christmas present and paid 33 for it What happened to the 8 It obviously didnt go to the consumer
__label__Positive	This is a great and easy way to recognize my son on Fathers Day
__label__Positive	Good deal
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are super easy to purchase I really like that I was able to print it off and insert it into my own card Thanks Amazon

__label__Positive	Great gift idea
__label__Positive	perfect can really cute
__label__Positive	I appreciate the fact that the gift card arrives at its destination the next day My son was happy to receive the gift card so that makes me happy
__label__Positive	No issues using the card and it arrived earlier than expected
__label__Positive	i bought it for my daughter who has an amazon kindle reader She has told me she is thrilled and is busy deciding what she will buy so all in all we are both happy Yes i would recommend it
__label__Positive	Always love Cracker Barrel
__label__Positive	This ones pretty hard to not like  If youre looking for a gift for someone Amazon is the place to go  Things can range from a new Kindle to toilet paper or diapers  itll meet the needs of anyone
__label__Positive	Wonderful gift to send across the country  The recipient was thrilled We saved shipping costs and she is able to get whatever she wants  Thank you Amazon
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Easy and fast checkout  Cute design
__label__Positive	nice way to give a gift card
__label__Negative	When I received this gift card box which I was planning to give as a Christmas gift was open when received and it was dirty  especially inside the lid
__label__Positive	Very Good BikeMy Grandaughter loves it the color and striping are very pretty with small flower as accent Sturdy and well made
__label__Positive	The recipient got the gift card via email in around 55 seconds God I love Amazon
__label__Positive	Very useful card
__label__Positive	Granddaughter loved the cards  Easily used at the store
__label__Positive	Acceptable gift and leaves wide range of choice to the recipient Also very useful for international gifts Instantaneous and environment friendly I hope
__label__Positive	Not sure what to say I guess your star rating depends on if you have to pay for it or if you get to use it  But they say the giving of a gift should be just as rewarding
__label__Positive	Works  Right size color and money is always in fashion
__label__Positive	Nice and easy
__label__Positive	We are a family who believes Jesus is the reason for the season so I was very pleased to find a religious gift card to send to our grandson And he has let us know that he was glad to get it
__label__Positive	Pleased
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	perfect birthday gift
__label__Negative	DO NOT BUY I got a 60 gift card and then when i tried to use it it said that it was no longer valid 5 mins after i bought it and I cant use it ye tthey still charged me 60 dollars DONT BUY
__label__Positive	Only problem is the person I sent it to deleted the email so I had to resent it so be careful with who you send it to
__label__Positive	Gift card  AWESOME How can I not LOVE something that gives me 100 to spend however i like Think im going to buy me some kindle books 
__label__Positive	Gift card  In a box What more can you want
__label__Positive	Buying the Gift Card  was a hastle free buy Absolutley no problems  I Will buy more Gift Cards  in future
__label__Positive	The smaller card that snaps out is kinda neat not sure why they attached it doesnt go on keys but its the same number  It fits in a front pocket of my bag so dont have to get out my wallet and its nice to know you have money for lunch

I buy them for myself get points back on ccs so its a deal  Saw another reviewer say you get a free cookie  Hasnt happened but dont need it  Subway is healthy fast food
__label__Positive	Gift cards allow people to choose their own gift  they can get something they want rather
than something I choose Good gift choice all around
__label__Positive	This was very easy and convenient I had this delivered the same day I purchased it My nephew loved the animated ecard too
__label__Negative	Fine to use and very handy for a quick gift
Seriously though Amazon  try searching to buy one of your vouchers on your web site I spent WAY too long to find it
__label__Positive	was a gift  how can you go wrong with an amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Receiver of this gift liked it a lot

__label__Positive	Easy because anyone with an account can buy a gift card in few clicks
Convenient because multiple options email to giftee print it yourselves select from multiple themes can purchase in a matter of minutes no need to go purchase anywhere in store
Great gift because of awesome value and flexibility offered to giftee to select from amazons amazing selection of goods
__label__Positive	Purchased as Christmas gift
__label__Positive	Reached our customers which is great but not enough to excite them as a potential prize
__label__Positive	Very convenient and like that fact that you are notified once it has been redeemed
__label__Positive	The popup packaging make it seem extra special
__label__Positive	My sister was delighted with this gift card as her wish list with Amazon is quite large  Great idea for a Christmas gift too

__label__Positive	Ok But not easy to purchase online had to set up an account Trouble with that
__label__Positive	Great product The 1080 picture is very good Even in low light I had a little trouble setting it up but thats not the cameras fault I would definitely recommend this product
__label__Positive	I love eating at Taco Bell I can also use the gift card for KFC Awesome

__label__Positive	Gift Card
Easy to print and so great to send it for a special gift of their choice  Have sent this as a gift quite a few times
__label__Positive	Easy proccess to buy
__label__Positive	Three out of the four gift cards that I received for Xmas worked great 100 worth They were easy to put into your system and redeem The forth card evidently was not activated when it was purchased I did contact Amazon concerning this and they said sorry nothing can be done  I see this as vary concerning I know that I cant prove that the card wasnt stolen but the fact that there were three other cards added to my account at this time and that it was the time of year when one would expect to see gift card activity It was just very disappointing that the money spent on this card will never be used for the purpose that it was intended
__label__Positive	Worked great for what I needed
__label__Positive	This card is SO cute  I Iove being able to send ecards as an Amazon gift card  It is pretty hard to beat Hoops and Yoyo because most of the people I know have a good sense of humor and they like outofthebox types of things
__label__Positive	Muy fcil de usar Y la fotografa me encanta 
__label__Positive	Convenient way to gift My grandaughter was delidhted to receive it so she can shop on her own Try it and see
__label__Positive	My grandson was very pleased with his birthday present
__label__Positive	Fast delivery and just the gift for my college gdaughter Food gift cards are jjust the ticket for young people
__label__Positive	What would be easier than picking up a quick gift card without having to go to Subway to do so My only gripe is that it was sent in an enormous box when it could have just gone through the US mail at a fraction of the price Christmas giftcard shopping was never so easy
__label__Positive	Very well received by all ages They can buy what they want and usually can find it at Amazoncom
__label__Positive	Made a perfect graduation gift
__label__Positive	Ordered this card for one of my employees for Christmas this year What can I say except I was able to buy this from Amazon on line and have it delivered to my house a few days later Saved me time and gas from having to go out to a store to buy it Why would you not buy it and have it delivered instead of having to go out and fight the crowds and parking lots Awesome buy for anyone who needs a gift card
__label__Positive	Given as birthday Present  and was happy with box
__label__Negative	After paying the 35 online I never received the email to print out the card  So the only thing I could give the recipient Carrie Ross Hofmann was the number that I had for the transaction  I noticed that the 35 was charged to my credit card though  I now learn that Carrie was unable to use the number and had to give Amazon my street address etc  How do we resolve this  In the past getting an Amazon gift card was no big deal  Let me know

__label__Positive	Gift of course its great
__label__Negative	Amazon had a promotion that if I gave a gift card of 50 to someone I would get 10 as a promotional thank you

I did my part in buying and giving the gift card but I waited a month Nothing from Amazon

So I contacted customer service They did everything in their power to try and not give me the promotion After sending the email and order details several times they finally relented and give me the 10 But they made it sound like they were doing me a favor

Bottom Line I will not participate in that type of promotion again
__label__Positive	Very nicely wrapped
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt like an amazon gift card for the holidays or anytime for that matter
Its my go to gift for other amazon lovers
__label__Positive	It came on time with no physical blemishes I assume it works but it will be a gift to my tasteless uncle
__label__Positive	Great shoes for a great price  I am constantly complemented on my heels at work 9 times out of 10 Well more like 18 times out of 20 with the amount of shoes I have they are from Payless

__label__Positive	Awesomely got laughs and was so fast and easy considering I had forgotten the b day
__label__Positive	Was a great idea for a Christmas present for my beloved who likes to purchase his own titles  quite naturally
__label__Positive	Its always good to have extra gift cards for a last minute party invitation And who doesnt love wings
__label__Positive	You can find anything on Amazon with any style gift card The receiver loved it and so will you  No shipping charges either
__label__Positive	I purchased as a wedding present for my niece  There wasnt a box that looked appropriate so I got it in this one  They were appreciative of the gift and I doubt they paid much attention to the box
__label__Positive	Just what I ordered and it came quickly
__label__Positive	Love that I can purchase a gift card from Amazon online

__label__Positive	ME LLEGO BBIEN
__label__Negative	This was a Xmas gift for my son He had one heck of a time redeeming it Amazon wanted him to create an account and give them a credit card number before they would allow him to use the thing He refused to give his credit card information and called customer service who took care of the situation On the bright side he did say customer service was very friendly and helpful

__label__Negative	Asked for it to be emailed on to my wife on Valentines Day Unfortunately I live in Australia so Valentines Day comes 16 hours before it does in the United States so my wife didnt get her present until 4 in the Afternoon

__label__Positive	Perfect gift idea  cool lil tin
__label__Positive	No hassle no wait immediate delivery
__label__Positive	This is a really cute way to give a gift card  it pops up as it opens  My only reason for taking away a star  the To and From shown on the example online was missing from the one sent to me  Not sure if they changed the design or I just got a bad batch but it would have been nice  I ended up writing it myself along with the dollar amount in Sharpie on the backside

__label__Positive	Quick easy and my Mom gets what she wants Great gift and I can do it last minute If youre looking for a great easy gift that anyone would love this is for you
__label__Positive	I would give these gift cards six stars if they offered more than five  For many years my wife and I agonized over every giftgiving occasion but especially Christmas  We shopped til we dropped went to toy stores department stores and all of the specialty stores and even small boutiques trying to find the perfect gifts for those on our gift lists  We did the Black Friday events and were up at the crack of dawn to do so  We then wrapped and sent these hand selected gifts all over the country to the recipients  Then came an epiphany we sent out Amazon gift cards in lieu of all the craziness that we had done for years  Holy Cow its nice to join the 21st century  Everyone LOVED them  Everything FIT no need to return or exchange  Christmas is no longer a stressful ordeal for us It is a season that has actually changed for the better no exaggeration
__label__Positive	Great value
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	i like this one since several family members are dog lovers
__label__Positive	These made excellent Christmas gifts for the extras that show up at Christmas  I will now keep some on hand for all the birthdays coming up including mine
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for someone Came on time as promised
__label__Positive	Great way to give a gift to the electronicminded people in your life Can be sent to them by email and directly accessible to the recipient electronically
__label__Positive	I had 5 minutes to print a gift card it worked and was a hit  It is different from those Gift Cards you pick up at the Pharmacy there is thought behind these  I print and decorate them
__label__Negative	Wasted hardearned money on this for a gift to my exgirlfriend
__label__Positive	Great gift for someone who is hard to buy for  I know that it will be used and enjoyed by mum
__label__Negative	Could not sign name or write message anywhere on card or envelope  Had to ask our son to write his girls names on the envelopes  Would have liked to write a personal message on each card
__label__Positive	Great gift for children
__label__Positive	I love everything about Amazon
__label__Positive	This is a perfect last minute gift or if you dont know what to get Amazon has everything Mine was a birthday gift
__label__Positive	I highly recommend this Gift Card You can always find something to buy with an Amazon Gift Card
__label__Positive	My daughterinlaw loves Amazon so a gift card FOR Amazon was just the thing she wanted
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Positive	Satisified
__label__Positive	Got it on time Thanks
__label__Positive	As described
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for a teenager  My grandson loved it
__label__Positive	Fast and recipient get immediately
__label__Positive	Its a gift card In a box so its a gift card in a box
__label__Positive	Great birthday gift
__label__Positive	Excellent Product
Excellent alternative means of payment
I like the article
I recommend it because you can buy all sorts of prodcutos
__label__Positive	Quick and easy to print The best last minute gift
__label__Positive	I brought this gift card for my brothers birthday and he liked
__label__Positive	as expected
__label__Negative	I cant argue strongly enough against these things My son got me one for my birthday which was sweet as heck of him  and the next chance I got we made plans to go see a movie together When I arrived at the theater and tried to actually use the card however I found that you cant do so  the card has to be activated somehow yet when you go to the fandango site and try to do anything along those lines all it does is give you a list of movies In other words the only way apparently you can actually use the card is to order your tickets online ahead of the showing

So if you arent positive of which movie youre going to see before you head out youre out of luck Given that I dont always know precisely how long its going to take for us to get all the way across town to the theater this is an asinine hoop to jump through Either we can block out an extra hour to see our movie  and sit through forty five minutes of obnoxious inescapable TV commercials that we pay to endure  or I cant use the heartfelt gift my kid gave me Poor guy spent his own money because he wanted to see a movie with his dad to celebrate my birthday and quite frankly I feel like he got ripped off

If you want to give a moviegoing gift Id suggest pretty much anything other than this See if the theater has gift certificates Give a prepaid visa card Anything Its absurd that a gift card  which was paid for with cash  is about as convenient to use as an expired discount coupon you cut out of the back of a cereal box

UPDATE I finally used the cards by ordering some tickets online  and had to pay a CONVENIENCE FEE ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE Yes for the nonconvenience of not even being able to USE these unless I order ahead of time four bucks of my sons cash was just sucked into the great aether Ill never voluntarily give Fandango a dime of my money ever again My kid is awesome Fandango isnt
__label__Positive	I purchased this for myself with some Amazon gift cards I was given at Christmas The email arrived quickly and I confirmed with the Whole Foods gift card page that the entire balance was there Ill try to update this tomorrow after I redeem the card at the store
__label__Positive	I ordered the 25 gift card with a birthday greeting on the inside  Supposed to be 12 day delivery  Problem is the item was delivered by UPS to the wrong address  Not the fault of Amazon but the inside of the card did NOT have the greeting that was supposed to be there  A neighbor was kind enough to bring the item to my house and I entered my own greeting on the inside of the card  All turned out OK but the overall experience could have been much better
__label__Positive	Perfect for the person who is so very hard to buy for
__label__Positive	The best gift ever I loved it
__label__Positive	GOOD
__label__Negative	Actually I was never able to make this work  I selected it a few times but it didnt process  I gave up  Good luck if it works for you  Its worth a try
__label__Positive	very easy
__label__Positive	I always love Kindle money
Thank you for the expeditious way it was delivered and efficient download system
William
__label__Positive	It is the greatest way to just enjoy more books  I love it This is all I want for gits from now on
__label__Positive	My friend in Ridgefield CT was thrilled with the Card  Please Open a Trader Joes or Whole foods near me in Murrells Inlet SC
The store would do land office business lots of middle aged and seniors waiting for healthy good stores  Dont want to drive 50 miles to Mt Pleasant
__label__Positive	Great first time experience getting this for a gift Would buy again thanks
__label__Positive	Easy to use
__label__Positive	Of course a gift card is always going to be welcomed Its the perfect gift for those who prefer to pick out their own presents Id much rather give a gift card than take a chance that what I choose is wantedneededused So yes Gift cards rock
__label__Positive	Great way to buy gift cards
__label__Positive	Super cute packaging  my favorite of all the gift card containers Always brings a smile to the recipients face And the best part of it  its free with the purchase of a gift card Instead of buying a separate gift card container  get this Everyone always loves getting Amazon gift cards  most practical gift ever next to cash
__label__Positive	Loved it  Made the gift card special
__label__Positive	Delivery was quick and ordered was easy Would have liked to see more design options available This was a Mothers day gift and there were no mothers day designs
__label__Positive	Ships from and sold by GiftCardMall
Bought both a 25  50 Gamestop GC on May 5th received May 10th
Both cards were activated  both cards have their full correct balances
Zero problems on 3 of 3 gift cards ordered and Ships from and sold by GiftCardMall third was a 25 Subway card
Will buy again  definitely recommend
__label__Positive	5 off and we used it for a gift
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card in any amount
__label__Positive	Love the ease of printable gift cards on Amazon  So easy and a great gift for the person you dont know what to buy for
__label__Positive	tow thimbs up as always I never have a problem with what I order If I have any questions I just ask and they are answered at a drop of a hat
__label__Positive	Fast shipping and good gift for a teenager
__label__Positive	My grandson was thrilled with this on Christmas morning  It gave him the chance to buy what he wanted for his Kindle
__label__Positive	This was a wonderful gift for a special young lady who will soon be a member of our family  She loved it
__label__Positive	I think this packaging is SO cleaver  Its adorable  Love it
__label__Positive	Awesome gift card holder
__label__Positive	shipped fast and came in a cool box
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	It did come on time and the reciever was very pleased It ist a nice thing to choose if you dont know what to buy Thank you
__label__Positive	Short on time and large on desire to give a useful gift  This fit the bill  I received one myself which was really a treat and so that is why I knew about the option to send this It was a time saver  
__label__Positive	cards are the best
__label__Positive	Was a great gift to give Very easy no need to find a card but also sweet
__label__Positive	Excelente forma de dar un agradecimiento
__label__Positive	During a holidaytime Lightning Deal we spent 40 on this 50 gift card and we used it with ease at our local BJs restaurant Great experience
__label__Positive	Gift card that is attached to a bear makes my life easier
__label__Positive	Amazon email delivery met my expectations to the fullest  I was freaking to start out with thinking I did something wrong but then it was right there within a couple of hours
__label__Positive	Wonderful online product Impromptu inviteparty gift
__label__Positive	recipient was thrilled to receive
__label__Positive	Love the packaging Thanks
__label__Positive	I like the ease of shopping for this online during the holiday season The person who received the card appreciated a gift that kept on giving
__label__Positive	Always a great choice and always on time
__label__Positive	Amazon gift card for Christmas  It was a big hit  It is perfect for anyone to order anything they want and have it shipped right to their door
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card I buy these for everyone on my Christmas list birthday list and as a way to say thank you
__label__Positive	It is a gift card
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	So easy
__label__Neutral	Ordered 4 egift cards Only 3 arrived
Resent from my order still only received 3
Taked to Amazon support and they resent from their end
Still only received 3
Finally received a 4th all 4 balances checked out with Brinker card balance and thought everything was good then a hour or so later I received another 1 which wiped out 2 of the good ones
Im still left with only 3 that have verified balances with Brinker which verifying is further complicated because Brinker will only allow so many cards to be verified 5 I think in one 24 hr period so I had to keep waiting a full day to check if what I had was any good
Im out 15  25 less the supposed 10 savings I got
Will never buy e gift cards again

UPDATE
Yesterday 1417 I made one more attempt to get 4 valid egift cards and was successful Thankfully after 15 days of effort I have what I ordered However I would be leery of ever purchasing multiple egift cards on one order One at a time maybe
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Neutral	My brother received the boxed card but that was all  None of the nice message I wrote for him in the Gift Message box of the order appeared anywhere in or on the gift  So be ready to call whoever you send this to so you can let them know who sent it
__label__Positive	happy with this purchase
__label__Positive	was a great fast easy gift
__label__Positive	love them
__label__Positive	My sister loves to shop on Amazon and what better gift than an Amazon gift card that is sent right to her email she opens the email and starts shopping
It works for me and especially works for her  She bought Rose of Sharon bushes to plant on her hillside in Washington
Thank you for making the gift cards so easy to purchase and spend Amazon
__label__Positive	My 11 year old nephew enjoyed the e card
__label__Positive	Yup Its a gift card Basically what you expect
__label__Positive	It was a practical gift that worked out
__label__Negative	I had to have the gift card for a birthday party I paid for 2 day delivery and thought it would be here on Monday at the latest Imagine my chagrin when it came on WEDNESDAY I was so embarrassed to try and explain at the birthday party for my best friend
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like a gift card
__label__Positive	30 Netflix card Apply it to your account the money is taken from this and not charged to your card Works on streaming or physical disc
__label__Positive	My son loved getting this as part of his birthday present with his kindle fire I love how fast he received it and how user friendly it was
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Recipient was pleased
__label__Positive	Great way to give a gift
__label__Positive	I feel incredibly lazy for buying this via Amazon instead of stopping by one of the nearby Starbucks and picking one up inperson However when youve got Prime youre actually saving money because youre not driving around everywhere picking stuff up like this inperson

right

Help me
__label__Positive	EASY TO USE NICE GIFT IT FITS ALL ALSO VERY LASTING SINCE IT DOESNT EXPIRE I WOULD SAY IT WILL BE NICE TO MAY BE ONE THAT ANY ONE CAN SET THE DESIRED AMOUNT
__label__Positive	Amazon most always has good prices so if gift acrd is what you would like to send somone they can get what they want at a good price and not have to supplement the amount on the card  Noce to put their photo on the card or a family photo or whatever you want
__label__Positive	The spoiled doggies insist on giving this a fivestar rating  Their mom is a regular shopper at Petco for mealtime basics and fun toys too
__label__Positive	Such a great ready to give gift card
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for daughter to use on her Kindle  Easy for me to give her as she lives outside of Canada
__label__Positive	Nice packaging for 10000 gift card Dont even have to worry about wrapping it
__label__Positive	Weve never been to the place but with limited options and days left before Christmas we were able to get this out to relatives in NC just Im time The reviews for this place made the buy even better
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love a gift card
__label__Positive	excelente servicio
__label__Positive	Was just what I wanted and both the ordering of it and the electronic delivery by Amazon is second to none

What a way to go I say or should I say the only way to go
__label__Positive	Love these gift cards
__label__Positive	Very pleased with my order I ordered these really early in the morning and had that evening
__label__Positive	Arrived quicklyis as described Make good gifts

__label__Positive	Have sent these to several people  They enjoy shopping on Amazon and thought the birthday cupcake was great
__label__Positive	is what it is
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cardwho wouldnt use that
__label__Positive	If a gift card has the balance you purchased I guess it gets five stars
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are great for our company We love to use them and they are extremely reliable
__label__Positive	When you cant think of anything This is the way to go They are really great to use and so easy
__label__Negative	Not good at all horrible experience treated like I had no money
__label__Positive	Received within 5 to 10 minutes and it worked when I used it I will order again
__label__Positive	Makes all games more beautiful  must have it
__label__Negative	Took 200 to CoinStar today and selected to receive an Amazon voucher to purchase gift cards  However since Amazon considers this voucher a gift card they do not allow you to buy gift cards  Unfortunately this is not disclosed on the CoinStar screens  Called Amazons customer service and they did say I could turn in the voucher for cash through CoinStar but I am sure they would then charge me their service fee  Next time I will skip CoinStar go directly to the bank and then buy gift cards for other stores
__label__Positive	Fantastic email delivery time and my son was able to use it right away
__label__Positive	So easy and with teenage granddaughters the best gift ever
__label__Positive	Very nice kids loved itwill recommend it

__label__Positive	I decided to return this itemafraid I wouldnt use it enough like I first thought I would
__label__Positive	like
__label__Positive	These Amazoncom Gift Cards are an easy way to give a gift  We recently attended a party celebrating the arrival of a new member to the family  The parents had flown to this event and of course would be flying home afterwards  Well not wanting them to have to deal with hauling more suitcases and boxes on the plane we told them of some of the gift items that we wanted to get for them from Amazoncom  By presenting them with a gift card they would not only receive their gift card at home in an email but would also be able to avoid all those duplicate gift did we get a gift receipt where did you put it when are we going to be able to take back this thing to exchange it for what we really wanted I hope they still have that red one baloney  When the situation calls for it go get that gift yourself  When that is not practical turn to Amazoncom for a hasslefree gift card
__label__Positive	Did just what it was meant to do Surprise

__label__Neutral	I wanted to give a subscription to Amazon Prime to a high school grad so he could use it throughout his college year when purchasing books and other items online  However I was told Amazon Prime is currently not available to give as a gift so I settled for this gift card not knowing whether he will use it to purchase Amazon Prime or not
__label__Positive	Great Giftcard
__label__Positive	Sent to my daughter while she was away at college She LOVED it
__label__Positive	I never know what to buy for grandsons  I found that an Amazon gift card is always a hit  The boys love to get on Amazoncom and shop shop shop
__label__Positive	Cute card Hoops  Yoyo are always entertaining
__label__Negative	Extremely complicated to use with kindle books The gift card is only valid for the Amazoncom store cant be used on other Amazon stores Navigating through the website is a pain

__label__Positive	It was perfect

computer savvy so may not use it again for that friend
__label__Negative	We sent this card to our business customer We sent it 2 times to one email address 1 time to second email address and with 0 result I had to call to Amazon  spent like 30 min on a phone and resolved this problem finally  Never again
__label__Positive	It was exactly what I was looking for It was totally appropriate as a get well gift and my brother really appreciated it
__label__Positive	My granddaughter received her card in time for Christmasthank you 
__label__Positive	I purchased a Kindle for my technologically challenged elderly mother

My Mum was an avid reader As she grew older the books she selected for reading went from normal standard books to books with larger print

Only problem with the larger print books is that they are few and far between

We my hubby and I took a gamble We raced around all the electronic shops that had eReaders there are a lot of them out these days and looked at everything that was available For ease of use simplicity easy reading and the ability to select the size of font you wanted coupled with a sufficiently large enough screen to be able to read larger fonts along with the lightness of weight required by someone feeble in body we selected one of the earlier Kindles

We then needed to load it with books and I noticed on Amazon that I could purchase a gift voucher THERE AND THEN ON THE SPOT and with NO WAITING FOR DELIVERY printed it out and included it in the Christmas Card that we gave to my Mum along with her Kindle

Althought excited at the prospect of being able to read again to say that she was dubious at first is an understatement

Christmas day we loaded her Kindle up Showed her how to use it Mum now had thirtyseven books loaded most of them free With over 2000 dollars still available to her for later use still she was dubious

We took her home

Nearly three weeks later we got a phone call she loved it but could I pop over Her Kindle had run out of power and she was halfway through a reallly good book

Suffice to say the Kindle coupled with her gift voucher has given my Mum back the ability to dissappear into the worlds she had believed until Christmas last year lost to her forever

Do yourself a favour Buy a Kindle for an elderly relative get the gift voucher Watch them come alive again  we did
__label__Negative	SCAM The card was invalid and we werent able to use it

__label__Positive	This is a great gift for my coworker
__label__Positive	I liked the packaging on this item  it was pretty cute I ended up sticking it inside of a Christmas bag still because  there is a barcode that shoes on the bottom of the box That just was weird to me Im sure that it is so Amazon is able to process and ship them quickly but I thought it looked ugly so into a bag it went

__label__Positive	made a great gift to the neighbor kids for getting our vacation papersmail
__label__Positive	Easy and fast
__label__Positive	Gift card works perfectly Not sure why so many people are screaming about false advertising

It says pretty clearly This card is redeemable for full price standalone Premium subscription months purchased directly from spotifycom and cannot be redeemed for discounted or group subscriptions

__label__Neutral	I was quite annoyed that my Amazon gift card did NOT arrive when it shouldve have I inquired about it but no one had the decency to get back with me Ill be rethinking the next time I want to get a gift card from Amazon
__label__Positive	Purchased this to gift to a friend so they could buy a digital game on amazon
Was fast and easy Within minutes i had the code and emailed it to my friend
Only prob was when my friend tried to purchase the digital game they were unable to redeem the code unless they entered their credit card info This was a problem since they didnt have one and I ended up having to temporarily set up my credit card on their account so they could complete the purchasewhich kinda defeats the whole purpose 
__label__Positive	good value awesome for birthdays
__label__Positive	This was a gift
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	 amazon makes this ultraeasy  w great card choices
__label__Positive	The recipient lived it
__label__Positive	It was effortless shopping using my Amazon credit card  free postage came with its own Xmas card and the recipient liked being able to make his own choice of purchase  Its a winwin

Next day delivery for free with Prime it got to my giftee sooner than I thought possible

If you know someone who loves to shop online or maybe even is new to shopping online Ive never had an experience that their customer support didnt go above  beyond to fix This gift card was an easy buy
__label__Positive	Great place to meet friends
__label__Positive	It was delivered right away and two people had a 4th meal
__label__Positive	Love this gift card design Great way to get a last minute gift
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	I purchased some Amazon gift cards as a last minute Christmas gift for some family members  I didnt know all of their email addresses so the Facebook delivery option was great  It showed me when they had claimed their card so I knew they received it and everything  Good old technology
__label__Positive	These ship and arrive almost as instantly as the online codes and make for great gifts for the finicky or less wellknown especially in the 3packs

Good designs and naturally very flexible
__label__Positive	I love purchasing gift cards because they allow the recipient to get whatever they desire This was a smooth and easy transaction I purchased the card it arrived like clockwork and I was even able to add in a personal note with the card

__label__Positive	I was confused on this gift
__label__Positive	It is what it is
__label__Positive	this product came before the due date it was easy to regestier i would recommand it to my family and friends
__label__Positive	The system worked like it should have
__label__Positive	easy
__label__Positive	Very sturdy package Could be reused for holiday gift card
__label__Positive	Better than a card
__label__Positive	Very appropriate for Christmas
__label__Positive	Bought as a Christmas gift Cute card
__label__Positive	Great gift idea Fast service
__label__Negative	This review is for its packaging  I purchased this gift card for a friends baby shower  When it arrived the box I picked the white box with a pink ribbon that carries the gift card is all scratched up and got some grey spots on it  it looks old  Other than that a gift card is a gift card Im sure it works fine  I hope Amazon knows that the company who handle their gift card shipping SUCKS
__label__Positive	Have ordered a few gift cards and they are always fast and simple to use and codes have worked without a problem
__label__Positive	I loved the option of being able to purchase and print the gift card from my computer in my last minute rush to ship Christmas gifts
__label__Positive	Wonderful way to gift a family member
__label__Positive	Everybody loves gifts
__label__Negative	I guess I should have gone to the Fandango to see if there were theaters where the gift card could be used first None near me If I could give less than one star I would Of course gift cards are non returnable I wonder if we will be near an area where this useless thing can be used before they go out of business For all of the aggravation they also add a fee to use the card

Having a business where you are unlikely to get return customers seems like a looser idea to me How long until you exhaust the pool of first time buyers

You are better off finding a theater chain you like and getting one of their gift cards
__label__Positive	Loved it 
__label__Positive	bought as a xmas gift wife she thought the packaging was cute I thought it was a great deal because I didnt have to wrap
__label__Positive	Who could possibly find anything wrong with an Amazon gift card

__label__Positive	Ill get this card I was been satisfied
__label__Positive	Arrived to the recipient quickly and I got an email saying it was redeemed
__label__Positive	Perfect for sending instead of mail Easy
__label__Positive	Arrived at its destination at its destination in a timely fashion  Why wouldnt it its electronic It was as I had requested in appearance and amount involved  However and I cant be precise but my giftee seemed to have had problems with redeeming the value of the card for some gifts and the delivery took an extra amount of time
__label__Positive	Easiest present to buy for anyone  Given all different options print code text code to person ect to give it to them  I just printed out a birthday card and went Just wish they had more customizable layouts for the cards
__label__Positive	Easy to print and give I live in a rural area and so its hard to get my hands on gift cards unless I drive over 100 miles to pick up This was perfectly convenient
__label__Positive	OK what can I say about this  Purchased for a gift arrived timely and in excellent shape  Im sure grand daughter will enjoy the 55 subs shell get with it 
__label__Positive	This premade template for a giftbirthday card is a great idea Love that it allows me to include my own greeting in it
__label__Positive	Perfect for the lazy or disconnected gifter
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always great and they are easy to send and to use  I love the idea that they can be sent at the last minute if needed but the receiver can shop a their leisure for something of their choosing
__label__Positive	they worked
__label__Negative	Why I did not get 10 coupon as specified when checked out the card
__label__Positive	I was laughing so hard at this animated card it was a nice laugh to have when being 7000 miles from a family member who would donate an ugly sweater anyway LOVE IT

__label__Positive	Great deal

__label__Positive	If you dont like the crowds traffic etc this is a wonderfully painfree way to get the gift cards you want I got it the next day
__label__Positive	Recipient loved it and so excited to star shopping  Have given a number of these to family and friends for many different occasions
__label__Negative	Ordered  this as a gift and the card backing was torn and bent in a few places  It looks like I carried it around in my wallet for a year  I cannot give this as a gift

__label__Positive	The card was sent by grandkids and their parents  So much better than the hassle of shopping choosing hoping what one choose is pleasing to the recipient shipping and waiting to see
__label__Negative	This product was completely damaged when I received it The tin was completely distorted and didnt open or close properly It literally looks like a car ran over it This was purchased as a gift so is really not in any condition to give to someone
__label__Positive	Great way to get my parents started purchasing the ebooks for their Kindle that we gave them for Christmas They select what they want while learning how to use their new toy
__label__Positive	My husband bought me a gift card for christmas and its like getting free books all year I just download them to my kindle and its so fast and easy I love it
__label__Negative	I purchased this gift cert thinking what a nice presentation box it would be umm NO  It came with a dent and a scratch  due to the fact I ASSUMED it would be fine I didnt open the packaging until the day I was going to present the gift cert  no time to returncontact or request another

__label__Positive	This is the easy part Its the ppl at safeway who have no idea how to redeem them I learned they have to press the eft button in order to process the card correctly otherwise it says override needed and that doesnt work either Also if u dont use it all make sure they dont keep it or u are out that money that remained on the card

__label__Positive	We were glad to see the option of The Manger Scene available for Christmas gifts cards This product arrived just we hoped and were promised by Amazon

__label__Positive	the recipient received it in a timely manner  The email card was cute but I would like more of a selection of email cards I can count on Amazon to deliver the order and notify me that it was received Thats always a plus
__label__Positive	My daughter loved receiving this on one of her lean weeks
__label__Negative	This was purchased from someone else and used my credit card

__label__Negative	never bought one
__label__Negative	The Facebook link would not load  After several attempts by customer service over a period of 2 days it was eventually canceled and the link had to be emailed to my recipient  Too bad the Facebook link didnt work it was a good idea
__label__Negative	I had to spend 20 minutes on the phone getting the Claim Code  Even though I followed directions to scrap off the covering of the number carefully it was unreadable think of a better way to get the customer to the Claim Code

__label__Negative	Be warned this gift card only works for US Amazon site  The gift recipient had to buy from US Amazon website even though they lived in Spain  There is an Amazon Spain site  however standard gift cards cannot be used on it  About 12 the gift card value ended up being used as freight  I though Amazon was one company  be sure to read the fine print
__label__Positive	Perfect way to get gift cards from Amazon  I love how i can use my prime card to get the points as well

__label__Negative	In two different circumstances Ive had my gift cards somehow vanish from my email I am huge on email organization They say theres no expiration date but I find this unbelievable

I had purchases 400 worth of gc and put them safely in a folder in my email After a month unused they were no longer there I searched everywhere for them and had a friends search for them as well About a months later a friend had purchased me 200 worth gift cards I used about 76 dollars worth Again they were placed in a folder in my email for later a folder with a few emails from a variety time lengths and now they are NO WHERE

Ive contacted amazon 4 times and theyre saying they are still working on resolving the issue Nothing has been fixed Its been 3 months I dont know whats hard about just resending the same gc code that I have purchased previously Whole Foods has been zero help About to be a non existing customer of them after perviously having them as my primary
IF YOU PURCHASE THIS GIFTCARD MAKE SURE YOU WRITE DOWN ALL THE INFORMATION AND DONT STORE IT DIGITALLY
__label__Positive	easy to order  personalize no extra cost easy to redeemall wonderful
__label__Positive	One of my favorite gifts I recieved over the holidays was a gift card for Amazon from my family  I was able to very quickly go to amazoncom and pick out what I wanted for new Kindle  Within just a few minutes my order was was paid for and on its was to me  Very quick and easy
__label__Positive	Easy to use just really great service to save some money to spend later

I will definitely will use this again
__label__Neutral	The gift card arrived in the gift box on time  However the gift receipt and gift message was missing  The recipient had no idea who sent it
__label__Positive	Great Quick and easy
__label__Positive	Ive never had any technical issues with Amazon gift cards thankfully  They make great gifts for anyone that shops online and they will even get a box to open once the pick something out  I also like being able to print one out or email it last minute
__label__Positive	Everyone loves these
__label__Positive	Accurate and delivered timely My mother loved the ability to use the card at will  As the purchaser I appreciated the multiplicity of options for the style which fit something my mother would like  I love Amazon and hope she allows me to spend some of it on me
__label__Positive	WHO DOESNT LOVE SUBWAY SO MANY CHOICES
__label__Positive	So fast and easy
__label__Negative	There was no gift card in the envelope I ordered 50 gift card for graduation and its not in there
__label__Positive	Its cute
__label__Positive	Farastic and easy to use
__label__Positive	The Bear is really CUTE
__label__Positive	
__label__Positive	Quick shipping and amazon is always a great gift
__label__Positive	I love being able to just click and send It was so easy to give this gift and then your recipeint can choose exactly which books they want in their collection
__label__Positive	This little Santa tin is adorable and an Amazon gift card is always a win
__label__Positive	Nice I gave it as a Birthday Present
__label__Negative	I had to resend it three times before it was received
__label__Positive	Quick process work in second
__label__Positive	Easy way to give them what they want
__label__Positive	I didnt even know you could get Sephora gift cards from Amazon nice surprise from the hubbs Now to shop
__label__Positive	Whenever I dont know what to buy my husband friends  family I go with a gift card Its a great last minute gift because it comes overnight if you have Amazon Prime or it can be sent by email etc They are good for every occasion  even come in gift boxes
__label__Positive	Bought the gift card for a Christmas gift  They loved the card
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	it was a very good option as a birthday present  good thinking by amazon to make it as an more attractive choice
__label__Negative	The recipient was not able to access the card via email  So the gift was never received
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are easy to order and send  You can get an email when the recipient receives the egift card which is great
__label__Positive	Loved the items and the service
__label__Positive	Fast shipping Good product
__label__Positive	Great tin package for the gift certificate
__label__Positive	Made 3 perfect stocking stuffers
__label__Positive	Ordered this online because it was MUCH cheaper  Shipped extremely fast  Looks great  Im going to add a big white bow to decorate it but super happy with the purchase  Good size too  Room to hold lots of cards
__label__Negative	What year is this  Amazon gift cards offers the very cute feature of uploading your own photos but then doesnt support files larger than 7MB

10 or larger MB is the standard smartphone photo size now

Ive tried for 15 minutes to find a software program or app that will compress my file size so I can upload a picture but cant find one  FRUSTRATING

But the worst part of my experience trying to purchase a gift card was Amazons error message was misleading  The error messages I received were either that my file type wasnt supported even though Im uploading jpg files and THEY ARE SUPPORTED or that it just didnt work  I didnt receive the appropriate error message that I was uploading a file size that was too large until about my 20th attempt

Please fix this bug  Immediately Amazon should improve their error messages such that when you attempt to upload a file that is 10 MB or larger you receive a message that you are uploading a file too large  This happened when I uploaded a 9MB file but not a 10 or 11 MB file

2nd Amazon should support file sizes up to 20 MB
__label__Positive	Well received
__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift card  A great idea for my Granddaughter who loved it as she loves shopping American Eagle
__label__Positive	a perfect gift for someone that doesnt need anything or hard to shop for
__label__Positive	Adorable box that gives a little extra zing to just giving a gift card
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for grandsons
__label__Positive	Gift box seemed a bit cheap but it came free with the card so its cool
__label__Negative	Purchasing a gift certificate from Amazon was an incredibly ridiculous experience  My husband a computer consultant for 16 years said your site was extremely unfriendly for the user  He gave up helping me and I started over the following day and was able to complete my purchase  All this for a 10 gift certificate to be printed out by purchaser Next time I will simply go to Barnes  Noble and buy one
I should add that I have purchased a number of other things from Amazon with little or no difficulty and been completely satisfied I think that made my problems with this purchase unexpected and even more annoying
__label__Positive	Bought 45 gift card Came with three little cute stocks and gave the stocks to my mom
__label__Positive	Couldnt get much easier
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	My daughter loves the pop up Im not sure if she liked the pop up or the card better
__label__Positive	yummy
__label__Positive	always love an Amazon GC and this one was really cute
__label__Negative	It was never processed
__label__Positive	Got it right after ordering Thank you
__label__Positive	Saved me 12
__label__Positive	Great gift cards Love Amazon as always
__label__Positive	Had a great time at Applebees wo feeling guilty cuz we spent less money
__label__Positive	Got this card for fathers day and it didnt disappoint It was a pretty basic card itself but all I wanted was the gift card anyways
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	This is the 1st time to get as an email as I was going to see a movie tonight  It worked just fine 
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a Gift Card
__label__Positive	First time ordering gift card and was surprised to find out they deliver on Saturday and Sunday Makes it easy
__label__Positive	purchased this as present
__label__Positive	You dont even know how much food and food like products you can buy for 50 at the OG  And the best part is after the all you can eat breadsticks you wont want to eat the next day eitherunless you have a balance remaining on the card and no desire for a reasonable BMI
__label__Neutral	Does not work at Albertsons 
__label__Positive	Its a gift card to the best place on earth
__label__Positive	this is a great idea if you forget to run out to get a birthday presentchristmas present etc different amounts for every budget and its sent directly to the receivers email very awesome
__label__Positive	This card was a gift for my son and it arrived in just a few days in a nice gift box
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong fast service and a little thought goes in when picking the holder
__label__Positive	Buy up a bunch of these keep them in a special drawer in the house  These are the best things to have on hand when you are unexpectedly invited to a party or when someone gives you a gift and you actually purchased them NOTHING  Who doesnt love going to the movies  Always a welcome gift  Having these guys in the drawer has allowed us to save face many times  Also you can treat yourself to a night out if the mood strikes you
__label__Positive	I liked everything  Easy to buy my sister got it on the day she was supposed to and she got to pick out whatever she wanted
__label__Positive	As long as the recipient is an Amazon user its great They can select whatever they wish and you dont have to worry about returns
__label__Positive	Great Product
__label__Positive	Daughter got what SHE wanted
__label__Positive	I really appreciated being able to get gift cards that I know my family will use
__label__Neutral	Its a great gift idea and all but its ridiculously overpriced Amazon has some nerve charging what they do for some gift card
__label__Positive	Daughter was happy
__label__Negative	I printed this out and the security code wasnt on the card I printed  Fortunately I kept a copy of the transaction on my computer and our neighbor was able to get it from that
__label__Positive	EXCELECTE VERY GOOD
__label__Positive	Item fit perfect works as it should
__label__Positive	I could not do better with the packaging and  Amazon is the best gift to give
__label__Positive	Great gift for anyone
__label__Positive	It would have been nice to have the option to print it out and hand it to the person
__label__Positive	My son loved this ecard
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a 25 dollar gift card
__label__Positive	A wonderful way to gift someone that like kindle books  This also allows the person to choose the books  Great
__label__Positive	I was secretly hoping these gift boxes were wooden but I knew they would be metal I was also secretly thinking of repurposing them into coasters I was tired I ordered them Saturday and received them Monday morning so I really cant complain I only gave it four stars because the backs have a little transparent window to see the gift card number and barcode  which I was secretly assuming they wouldve been solid no need to scan them if I bought them online rightright Who knows I just wish there was a picture of the back of the box so I knew 100 what I was getting That is a terrible gripe but I foregoed getting a promo 10 back for buying holiday themed amazon gift cards to get these prettier boxes which I then used to pay rent with First world problems
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Cute Packaging
__label__Positive	The Amazon products and prices are Amazing When it comes to a need to buy an item my first choice is Amazon
__label__Positive	It worked amazing as a gift card lived up to all expectations covered like two tickets a small popcorn and some napkins would highly reccomend
__label__Positive	It was for a present very good deal at the right moment
__label__Neutral	They made my pizza wrong and the pasta tasted funky They gave me both items at a later visit for free The pizza was good but the pasta still has an off taste
__label__Positive	Util
__label__Positive	Between the festive santa suit tin box and the awesome card I couldnt say no Perfect for those tricky people who seem to have everything
__label__Positive	If you have the email of the friend or family whom one needs to send a last minute gift then this is the way to do it It was instantaneous  I will use this method again and recommend it to anyone whom needs to get it there fast Good luck Dont waste time anywhere else  use Amazons Gift Card
__label__Positive	Love it
__label__Positive	it was a good experince
__label__Positive	Muy bien gracias
__label__Positive	great deal
__label__Positive	worked perfect
__label__Positive	Really love these gift card holders I thought it was just all penguins but once I opened them I seen that they were different They are really cute and hold the gift cards well

I would recommend it especially if you have children in college To make sure your children are eating and this is what I asked my parents when I was going to uni
__label__Positive	An easy way to send cash to purchase what you need
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with a gift card  Family living far away can get what they want not what you want for them
__label__Positive	ADORABLE

__label__Positive	this card was a gift for my son who is in college and studying overseas for a semester Didnt really know what to get him for his birthday so I thought an Amazon gift card would be a good choice so that he could get something he wanted or needed while away from home

__label__Positive	excelent
__label__Negative	I wanted a plain Amazon Gift Card  NOT Kindle  It was for my 14 year old Great grandson and he has NO kindle products  Just what do I do now  I cant return it
__label__Positive	Here is a gift that everyone loves Then they can get what ever they really like No more crocheted socks

__label__Positive	My brother loved this the card decoration was awesome and the gift card is just what he wanted
__label__Positive	Sweet  Putting this toward my new rifle
__label__Positive	The Amazon online gift card was so easy to use Best part is that you can either plan way ahead up to a year in advance I believe or if you are a procrastinator like me wait until the last minute and send a little something even on the day of the event My sister loves getting these cards to apply towards kindle purchases
__label__Positive	Perfect choice
__label__Positive	Easy and convenient
__label__Negative	Totally useless Didnt get any response from this complete waste of money
__label__Negative	The gift card is made of cheap paper and the amount doesnt appear on the card
__label__Positive	This product is what the people need now a days for convenience  Some people call it evasive and impersonal but sometimes this is better than nothing  It allows for efficiency to allow the recipient the freedom of purchasing their own needswants  This day in age socks isnt the way to go for a birthday or a tie for dad on fathers day  Now dad can choose Madden 13 or some gearhead part that the wife would have to write it down verbatim and do an infinite amount of research to figure it out
__label__Positive	Love this feature
__label__Negative	too bad Manager of Whole Foods in Mill Valley have not seen Fresnos Store  Such an extreme from a junky throw it all out there image to a truly a gorgeous PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP store in Fresno  where you want to buy everything from produce fish meats deli items bakery goods shelf items cards lovely flowers and plantsall meticulously maintained

Now since Amazon took over the Mill Valley Store looks worse then ever and they seem to be on empty on many itemsEven though prices are higher Good Earth far surpasses the appearance of Whole Foods of MV

__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	The card with the voucher for Amazon was the most relevant and appreciated gift for my elderly father He needed help to navigate the computer but had hours of fun looking through the enormous library of books available He has requested that ALL his gifts be for Amazon
Thank you for a fantastic gift idea
Very happy and we will certainly use the Gift Cards again

Tess and Jay 
__label__Positive	Very cute
__label__Negative	I ordered a gift card on 1212 for my nephew for Christmas and was told it would arrive by 1217 By 1224 it had not arrived so I called Amazon Another card was issued and I received it on 1228 I was tracking the original card and it apparently was held up somewhere in Kentucky When I called Amazon with my complaint the woman I spoke with initially had some difficulty understanding my call I was on the phone with her much longer than I would have anticipated My new card did arrive in a timely manner I am somewhat surprised that Amazon didnt offer me a credit for not sending the original card
__label__Negative	Disappointed because my message was not on the card
__label__Positive	I couldnt believe how easy the online gift card purchase process was and was thrilled I could easily create a photo gift card  Amazon you own Zappos so now you need to transfer the same functionality to them
__label__Positive	Definitely recommend
__label__Positive	Yep I bought this sent it as gift notified when sent when recieved And you know what Birthday girl was very happy with it and the mission it entailed shopping
__label__Positive	Thanks Amazon for including a free gift box during the Christmas season  It was a pleasant surprise when I went to checkout and I loved the funny little Santa box  The card box is metal fully printed in color and very cute
__label__Positive	Now I know my meal is always paid for
__label__Positive	thanks
__label__Negative	I had to resend the card after fathers day and couldnt pick the same fun picture Ill never send an online card again Amazon gives you two day delivery if you send someone a plastic card
__label__Positive	It is convenient and fast option It does require to confirm credit card which is inconvenient but more secure option
So far I have no any issues with Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	So easy when you dont have a clue
__label__Positive	Great choice  can be used for anything that Amazon has to offer Very practical and appealing to the eye as well
__label__Positive	I ordered this gift card for a friend as a birthday gift It arrived quickly and with a birthday card Couldnt have been easier
__label__Positive	0
__label__Positive	Quick easy safe and versatile way to purchase anythingeverything via Amazon I received mine as a Christmas gift and purchased items on my wish list
__label__Positive	This gift card changed my life Instead of spending an hour under the covers reading I often spend the entire day
__label__Positive	My husband loved the box
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards allow the recipient to choose something special from a wide array of choices  Frequently something I wouldnt have purchased for them myself
__label__Positive	The value
__label__Positive	Great Idea for a gift  I use them regularly especially for people that are hard to shop for I recommend it
__label__Positive	Excelente servicio 100 recomendado D

__label__Positive	my cousin loved it thx
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Wonderful to be able to print 3 gift cards for the guys in my family
when you know they would rather have this as a gift
__label__Negative	was not included a card with the name of the sender the gift
__label__Positive	excelente producto cumple con las expectativas y las necesidades del usuario facilitando las transacciones a travs de otras formas de pago
__label__Positive	I think that an Amazon Gift Card is a terrific gift  The person that receives the card can purchase any item on Amazon that he or she would like  Since Amazaon has such a wide variety of items the selection is great  They have different gift cards that you can choose from
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are always make a great gift
__label__Positive	The gift for whom this was purchased expressed great gratitude She found it easy to use
__label__Positive	Ordered 5 cards in 2 separate orders all 5 were activated and worked at the store  Thank you
__label__Positive	An easy gift for any occasion I recommend it
__label__Negative	I had to call tech support because everytime I printed the certificate it just came out as a black square the word Electronics and the pictures would not print  Tech could not fix and also said I could not change the picture to another one
So I cut out some Christmas picture and pasted it over the black box  Hopefully you will be able to fix this
Recipient loved the gift though  Thanks
__label__Positive	very easy to do
__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift card they are always good when you need something in a hurry Yes I forgot a birthday

__label__Positive	Amazon didnt charge me any extra to buy it through them I paid 25 and got 25 It was quick and easy and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a Sephora EGift Card

Keep in mind that it isnt a physical card but a code emailed which is what I wanted but if you want a tangible card this isnt it
__label__Positive	Bought the printable gift card for a coworkers birthday Only complaint is that even with a color printer the gift card number does not show up on the gift card  you have to write it in I spoke to numerous other people regarding this  they all had the very same issue
__label__Positive	My nephew got a big kick out of the card and loved the idea that he could shop on Amazon instead of one of the local sporting goods stores
__label__Positive	We love Olive Garden  Food is great and they have a kids menu that my kids really enjoy

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card  When you are buying a gift card for yourself it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off  We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20 off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price  Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal
__label__Positive	This was a great way to get a gift for my grandson He had several Lego sets on his wish list and Amazon had the best prices So I figured this way he could pick out which one he wanted most
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love Amazon  There is always something for everyone  Makes gift giving in a complex world simple  Thank you
__label__Positive	Great product couldnt be happierA
__label__Positive	Gave as a gift Recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Whats not to like about a discounted gift card

We eat quite often at OCharleys so love it
__label__Negative	Very nice gift
__label__Positive	easy for me and grandchildren to buy and use
__label__Positive	perfect gift

__label__Positive	Lightning Deal Nice savings  Great salads and sanwuches
__label__Positive	Easy and fast
__label__Positive	Quick and easy  The recipients received their money instantly  Proven to be very useful I will definitely use this service again
__label__Positive	Thank You

__label__Positive	As described
__label__Positive	always meets our expectations 
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	My mother loved getting this for Mothers Day I loved that I could set its delivery date and time to sendbe received in her email She loves that she can add it straight to her account for Kindle purchases
__label__Positive	My best friend was so happy to receive this gift card
__label__Positive	Sometimes its hard to find a card with the right amount on it and the preload your own amount cards can also be a little hard to find  Thats why I was happen to find that you can get these  Its great because you can choose a select amount or put in your own and the you can send it to whoever you want  I know you can just use your credit or debit card on Facebook but I like how you can use this as a buffer just in case  Its great for family friends or yourself if you need it
__label__Positive	excelent
__label__Positive	Our grandson was very happy with his gift  Were glad this gift option is available
Well probably purchase it again
__label__Positive	Very convenient
Evite invitations now have an option to send Amazon Gift Cards
__label__Positive	The card is gorgeous Cant wait to give out more
__label__Negative	I didnt like the gift card was missing a piece
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Im not really sure what else there is to say except It was cute it worked and it made a cute gift for my motherinlaw  
__label__Positive	It was a last minute situation so I would not forget my daughterinlaws birthday The gift card did the trick Took me a while to get it done since this was my first try using Amazon Gift Cards She was delighted to get a gift that enabled her to buy what she really wanted
__label__Positive	quick and efficient service and a great price make this a great deal for anyone looking for this product buy
__label__Positive	Its absolutely amazing I bought this gift card for a 100 value and when it arrived it had 100 credit value on it Can you believe it Nice to see a product that works these days And yes I a being sarcastic Do we really need to rate a gift card
__label__Positive	always a welcomed gift
__label__Positive	super quick and easy gifts for my super picky brothers thanks for the last minute save amazon this was great
__label__Positive	Great thanks
__label__Positive	Yes the packages were great and I was very pleased with the order Thank You Amazon
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	Perfecto
__label__Positive	My daughter loved receiving her ecard for her birthday She cant wait to use it for the things she needs and wants
__label__Positive	Its a gift card in a little diamond plate looking metal tin  The back side of the tin has a clear plastic viewing window the exposes the back side of the included gift card  The tin could be used to hold other gift cards or small parts after the recipient takes the Amazon card out however the Amazon symbol is printed on the tin and might look odd giving a Home Depot gift card in it
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly
__label__Positive	This gift card comes in a cute festive container  It is perfect for the holidays
__label__Positive	Tsunamis isnt just a restaurant  Its an experience  The sushi is phenomenal and the atmosphere is electric Gift cards make my gift giving so convenient
__label__Positive	Maravillosaaa
__label__Positive	Very handy gift I love the little tin box that they came in These gift cards rounded out my grandson Christmas nicely
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Wonderful
__label__Positive	As expected
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love getting one of these
__label__Positive	Came in much faster than expected Saw the reviews for it and called to confirm the amount was loaded accurately and it was Easy and fast Will buy again
__label__Positive	Good value considering its a 50 gift card and you get a little cheap gift box for free with free delivery to your door
Its just a regular cheaply made paper box Nothing like the amazon gift card that arrives in a tin gift box cant beat that

4 stars because a gift message written with my order was not attached and the recipient just got a gift card with no invoice or message
__label__Positive	This is my favorite Cute tin and a great service
__label__Positive	received as it is very trustful seller
__label__Positive	I Loved it Came in 3 days
__label__Positive	Great gift for a teen I knew it was received and was even thanked via Facebook More communication than usual
__label__Positive	This is a gift for my Mom who doesnt like to cook Two 50 gift cards So convenient from Amazon with Prime Service
__label__Positive	Easy and fast
__label__Positive	I THINK THIS IS A GREAT GIFT BECAUSE  THIS WAS AN IDEAL GIFT FOR THE PERSON WHO LOVES TO SHOP ON AMAZON
__label__Positive	Nice convenient way to order a gift card Card came in green packaging and clearly marked Highly recommended for those who are unable to get to a local Starbucks
__label__Positive	This was a gift I love that it was delivered straight to their email
__label__Positive	Nice graphics on card Daughter loved it
__label__Neutral	I ordered this for my grand children and I also include not in each card for each of them
All three cards arrived  fast and none of them had my note on them
I do not understand if they are going to send these cards blank why they ask for greetings
__label__Positive	Grandson loved the gigt and the way it was packaged
__label__Positive	The perfect gift for any age any genderAmazon has EVERYTHING  What more could you ask for  Id like someone to give me one  It comes fastand you can choose your styleEASY
__label__Positive	whats not to like a bout a gift card  Awesome
__label__Positive	Way to go if you dont know what to buy  for someone  it was gratefully accepted
__label__Positive	Met my requirements
__label__Positive	This is the easiest way to give someone a birthday gift or any kind of gift

Rather than purchasing a gift that someone may not like and then paying for packing and delivery with confirmation etc the card is a more practical option  You can roll that packaging and shipping cost into the cost of the item and send an Amazon gift card thereby giving the person something they can use to purchase something they really want on Amazon

I love the cards and with so many family members living at distances I find the card to be not only the easiest but the most practical option  I would truly recommend this type of giftgiving to any of my family or friends

They are also fun to receive I know that personally
__label__Positive	No issues say delivered to recipients email as requested
__label__Positive	The bear is SOOOO SOFT great freebie if you already spend a lot of money on Amazon especially on Holidays Amazon we need a bigger version of this next year D

__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	It is excellent way to keep my money waiting meanwhile i decide what to buy this for venezuelan cases 
__label__Positive	Great card great gift to give to nephew
__label__Negative	Double check your card balance when it arrives mine was 0
__label__Positive	Cute card and was well received  
__label__Positive	This saved me from being the worst aunt in the world Time got away from me and I didnt send anything out for my nieces Bday so we sent her this and she loved being able to go online and pick something out
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with a gift card
__label__Positive	The Amazon video cards are so much fun Keep them coming
__label__Positive	Met my expectations I will probably use it again for one of my friends  Hope it works for everybody else too  
__label__Positive	I buy these all the time because they are not plain they are playful just as the Season needs
__label__Neutral	Would have liked more options of pictures to choose from for the actual birthday card but did work for the occasion needed
__label__Positive	I got this card for 20  Great price
__label__Positive	Baby shower gift
__label__Positive	Easy to keep on hand and use as needed
__label__Positive	Good stocking stuffer for my daughterinlaw who enjoys Steak n Shake
__label__Negative	I wated a5000 card in Canadien  my daughter got a card in USAfor which my Visa was charged
I will not order gift card from you in the future
__label__Positive	Everybody loves them We buy for clients
__label__Positive	Was a surprising Christmas present for a FB friend
__label__Positive	Always easy to order  Thanks
__label__Positive	I got this from my son for Christmas so I could order books etc for my new Kindle Fire which is awesome by the way  I think this was so incredibly thoughtful of him  The only complaintwarning I have is that you have to set up oneclick purchasing to order things from the Kindle  The only problem I have with this is that oneclick doesnt give you the option to use another form of payment  I solved this by using the gift card for oneclick purchases for books but order other things from my laptop where I get the choice at checkout to use another payment method so that I dont use up my gift buying gifts for others sounds a little selfish when I actually write that  I guess this adds another level of protection in case I lose the Kindle or it gets stolen since they could only use it to buy stuff up to the amount left on the gift card
__label__Positive	Pretty good
__label__Neutral	Wish description had made photo size  aspect ratio clear  I used a different gift card as a model for the photo since they all seemed to be the same  When I uploaded the pic was smaller than Id planned with extra white space above and below  Didnt have time to redo so my Happy Birthday message wasnt as clear as Id intended  other visual details were more obscure as well
__label__Positive	Quick ship item as described
__label__Positive	Convenient for out of town young adult
__label__Positive	Convenient edelivery
__label__Positive	Great Item
__label__Positive	easy gifting
__label__Positive	I purchased this gift card for my son for Fathers Day  I am sure he likes the card and will use it soon as he buys many items from Amazon Both he and I like the metal case  it is in
__label__Positive	Ordered this for a birthday gift The recipient loved the the gift and the little box in came in also
__label__Positive	Great Gift Idea
__label__Positive	A perfect Christmas gift with no expiration date  You cant go wrong with this
__label__Positive	It was easy to obtain and I could choose the amount I wanted rather given only specific amounts  I liked the design
__label__Positive	Great for gifts
__label__Positive	Its a gift card  whatever
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	I love the little tins for gifts  And they can also be used later for any gift card
__label__Positive	Got this for my friend who lives overseas I had my 2 year old color it before dropping it in the mail Sure its old schoolbut it was a success
__label__Positive	Super simple gift
__label__Positive	I did not receive a dirty box as others had remarked The box was clean and looked just like the picture This gift was for a friend who had a baby recently and it was a good presentation for a gift card

__label__Positive	Very Happy
__label__Positive	Its a e gift card Great for convenience and for allowing the recipient to spend as he or she sees fit
__label__Positive	I was skeptical at first because of the negative reviews However I purchased the gift card in the amount of 40 using an Amazon gift card I had and received it in my email in as little as 5 minutes Super quick delivery I redeemed it and the full amount was on it I was able to print it out and use in store at Sephora with absolutely no problems
__label__Positive	You get what you pay for
__label__Positive	Everybody loves an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	gave it to my daughter for hr birthday and she loved it was very easy to do and so I will be using them in the future
__label__Positive	For this gift card it was important to me that it get to my friend without delay but also without my having to pay extra to expedite delivery  Also I didnt want to use the option of sending a gift card by email

I dont know how Amazon did it but I ordered on a Saturday and a physical gift card and my personalized greeting were delivered the next day  Sunday

Ordering on the weekend and having it handdelivered on a Sunday at no extra charge astonishes me Wow
__label__Positive	Good quality gift box Cute
__label__Positive	Since Amazon has such a wide selection of products the card is perfect when you do not have a clue what a person needs or wants
The print your own gift card saved time and money to go shopping
I also knew that the recepiants of these gift cards were frequent Amazon costomers
The cards were great when there is no time left to shop

__label__Neutral	Its hit or miss depending on the store you go to and if their system is updated

__label__Negative	Cant expect me to give a gift card to a friendlike thisdo you
__label__Positive	Great for incentives for my team and quick gifts for unexpected occasions
__label__Positive	What is there to say It made gift giving easy and convenient The recipient was very happy because she could get whatever she wanted And I didnt have to stand in line at the post office during peak Christmas shipping season
__label__Positive	Works great for my needs
__label__Positive	gift certificates are great when you live far away
__label__Positive	One of our favorite places to eat  Always good food and the prices are reasonable to great  We used to think they were too expensive  However after a few visits especially with coupons we found the place to be very competitively priced  The biscuits and gravy when they have them are pure heaven  Dont forget happy hour between 2 and 4 each day  Half price on milk shakes between 2 AM and 4 AM as well as 2 PM and 4 PM  A great time to enjoy one of their hand dipped shakes  YUMMY
__label__Positive	My son lives 3000 miles from me but he is an avid reader I am most happy to provide him with a birthday gift of this sort
__label__Positive	Was great to be able to get online

__label__Positive	awesome
__label__Positive	I got this as a lastminute christmas present and I was so happy to see that it was delivered right away and there were no problems
__label__Negative	I didnt receive my order

__label__Negative	Its a gift card and worth what it says My issue is that its just cardboard and very flimsy cardboard It wasnt protected at all in the shipping package and as a result is all bent and looks like its been in someones wallet for years Cant give it as a gift as intended
__label__Positive	great gift  son loved it
__label__Negative	One of the people I gave this gift card to told me that it was rejected as invalid when she presented the card for payment at BJs She was humiliated and so am I Now I have to ask the 4 other people I gave gift cards to purchased from Amazon via ACI Gift Cards Inc if theirs has been rejected Embarrassed doesnt begin to describe how I feel

__label__Positive	Love the ease of buying gifts without having to make a trip to the store
__label__Negative	The voucher didnt come through to my email for about 6 hours Way too long to wait
__label__Positive	Simplified method of putting money on grandchildren account Like being able to select the amount The kids love receiving them
__label__Positive	What can be said of a gift card Lots especially a gift for the hard to please person in your life We all have that someone or those people that no matter how much time or thought you put into that special gift it is never quite right Gift card to Amazon yes You can get them one with a theme picture on it and you can even have it in a box or you can do both I would never be disappointed with a Amazon gift card and neither would those people

__label__Positive	amazon gift card  how can you go wrong
__label__Positive	This little gift was a life saver for me this year My christmas shopping was cut short This gift card option allows you to pic a cover picture and lets you add a personable message  Considering that amazon is very popular and the prices are decent it worked great as gift for someone who loves books and movies
__label__Positive	Its cute its happy its easy to buy and print and I was able to help my boyfriend get something he really wanted
__label__Positive	great gift and delivered timely
__label__Negative	Tried to buy s 50 gift card with a offer of a15 credit with the code 18Gift There was not s place to enter the code for the gift card What a disappointment in Amazon promoting this phony deal Russell
__label__Positive	It made it so simple to send a gift that would be appreciated and was sooo appropriate for that person
__label__Positive	Card was very festive and colorful
__label__Positive	Very nice a Chrustmas gift for my son
__label__Positive	This was easy to use and made a nice stocking stuffer  I would get an Amazon Gift card again because there are so many ways to spend it
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	OK Ease of use
__label__Positive	I have a student who lives across the state  His teachers were wonderful this year and really helped him out in so many ways  I wanted to thank them for all their hard work with this struggling student  This was the perfect gift and the teachers loved that they could pick out a little something for themselves  I got the amount in 25 so that they would be able to use the free super saver shipping  They really appreciated the gesture
__label__Positive	The gift box is a very classic elegant design equally good for an adult or a teenager I was very pleased with this purchase
__label__Positive	What could be easier  Always hits the mark for appropriate gifts My family always know exactly what they want and can always find it on Amazon
__label__Positive	Its a gift card and it works There is gas in my car
Id rather not have to buy gas at all so maybe Irving can do something about an alternative fuel
__label__Negative	This was a fraudulent purchase made by someone who hacked into my amazoncom account
__label__Positive	What can you say  Gift Card is a Gift Card
__label__Positive	I bought this for my daughter who lives several hours away  It is hard trying to buy and send her something  This was perfect
__label__Positive	It did not come dented
__label__Positive	always a great gift
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	It was a perfect gift just in time as well No need to even go to the shops
__label__Positive	On its own its good for getting Amazon credit for yourself or sending it to friends family quickly without extra charge Also you can use it to in increments combine your gifts But not great because it is only good for amazon credit and you have to individually one at a time add the exact amount of left over card balances Theres no option to just pay with more than one payment source each purchase
__label__Negative	I had purchased this gift card as a gift to a relative and it turned out to be the worst mistake I could have made The thirdparty vendor never funded or activated the card according to Apple Support When I contacted the vendor they refused any solution and used Amazon policy as a loophole in their theft and selling of illegal gift cards
__label__Positive	Greatest gift to give
__label__Positive	Bought it for my mom on Christmas to use with her kindle I have heard no complaints easy to use and shipped quickly
__label__Positive	Its a gift card

__label__Positive	We needed a present for a friend of ours who decided to invite everyone over on a Sunday spontaneously Here in Germany stores are closed on Sundays so this was a great alternative especially since you can just print it at home Great present without excess packaging thatll just end up in the trash anyway

__label__Positive	Wonderful way to celebrate a birthday
__label__Positive	very simple and easy
__label__Negative	I obviously cant write a review for each card  However I have not been too pleased with Amazon this year  Almost everything arrived when it said it would  The gift card situation however is getting worse and worse  These arrived at the recepients home as requested with all the gift cards mixed together and the gift tags all mixed together  Mostly they were the same amount so it was easy to say  these and these names but there was one that was different  I personally dont write on my gift cards Merry Christmas Blank  Here is your gift card for X amount  Love you  I just dont operate that way  Guess next year I will send them each separately  Which is ridiculous unto itself  If Amazon needs to hire more packagers perhaps they should
__label__Positive	Received the gift card d promptly  in great condition
__label__Positive	Its a gift card cant say anymore than that

__label__Positive	Whats not to love
__label__Positive	I purchased this gift card for a child with a broken leg It was difficult to take him out shopping so this was a great solution He loved looking online at his gift choices which occupied a lot of his time He loved getting to choose his own gift Since I live out of state a gift card was perfect choice for me as I didnt have to pay shipping costs
__label__Positive	Oh well it was the perfect way to make a present to someone whos living miles away

__label__Positive	I very nice way to put a special touch on a token of appreciation
__label__Negative	l am so disappointed with the mess our gift to our granddaughter turned into my husband made the mistake of choosing au  instead of uk pounds we were on holidays when she emailed us to say she could not spend the giftcard on the uk site there followed a stream of emails between you and my husband then you and me  as l had sent the order from my computer we were offered a refund then told  noonly a credit ws available and you needed comfirmation from our granddaughter that she had not used it  which we sent then we asked to use the credit to resend her a card in pounds no you cannot buy a giftcard with a credit l now have a 30 credit and have put 30 in a card and posted it all we asked you to do is convert the giftcard into pounds how hard is that l will have to think long and hard before trusting you again regards jeanne bonney
__label__Positive	I am so glad that these are available and so easy to send  I wasnt sure what to give my sister and didnt have time to send a card with a check so this was a great solution

__label__Positive	He loved it
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Sent it to grandchildren overseas so they could get material to read or buy They appreciated having it for personal use
__label__Negative	I bought these cards as a birthday gift but for some reason neither of the cards from Amazon could be activated  They refunded my money but I had to figure out a plan B on short notice  Kind of a disappointment
__label__Positive	This is a great way to send a gift to the person who has everything Can buy what they want
__label__Positive	Excellent  gift was a hit and we sent it direct while the recipients were out of town

__label__Positive	This is so cute for presentation of an Amazon card Love it
__label__Neutral	My wife who received this gift Card was unable to use it until we contacted Amazon there was no instructions as to high to attach it to your account after a customer serviced call I think the problem is solved

I dont know why you cant attach a message to the email gift card or send a email to a recipient of one of your gift certificates on how one needs to enter it into their account to be able to use it
__label__Positive	It represented a NYC skyline  It reminded my nephew o f when he visited the city  He had a great time on that visit
__label__Positive	50 for 50 ummm you got what you paid for
__label__Positive	Starbucks card easy to use

__label__Negative	I didnt care for the tin  Looks better in picture
__label__Positive	Sent as a present for my daughter She loves it and will enjoy using it We like to send each other amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	This is a great item to have around for any last minute gift options  We have used 2 of the 3 just this past holiday for people we could not find a great gift for  So handy to have them around  Easy to activate and activation is instant  I will be adding these cards on another order to make sure we have enough around for birthdays holidays and celebrations  Who doesnt love getting an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	50 dollar gift card purchased for 40 Ill buy it every time
__label__Negative	On May 15 I sent an email to Amazonordered a gift card to be delivered on May 16  The gift card did not arrive on May 16
Several days later I contacted Amazon  Amazon could not explain why the email had not been received  I asked Amazon to resend  But once again the email gift card was not received  Several days later I called Amazon again  I gave Amazon another email address to use  AGAIN the email gift card was not received  I called again and asked Amazon to try again  Finally after about 3 weeks the email gift card was received
__label__Positive	My 7 year old had a blast coloring in this sheet to give to her friend for a birthday  And of course you could just leave it blank for the receiving kid to color in how they want

__label__Positive	This product has exceeded my expectations cart Recommended for future purchases Very responsible all information is correct BUY HERE AGAIN
__label__Positive	This is a great way to ensure your preorders are delivered without any payment issues Will do this in future
__label__Positive	It was delivered quick great gift for graduation
__label__Positive	Just so happened that I needed a JoAnn gift card Heck just go to Amazon to see if its sold on the web site It is Email delivery I am happy
__label__Neutral	The gift card itself was fine and it was convenient to have the box  I did know that the box was black and that the bow was orange when I ordered it but it really looked like a Halloween box once I had it at home  It would be nice if the only color combo offered wasnt orange and black
__label__Negative	Wish I had read the reviews before I bought this  Thought I was getting all 6 but instead paid 6 for 1  Almost false advertising  It doesnt say 6 but it doesnt say 1 either
__label__Positive	Loved it  It was so cute and happy I had everything that I wanted and expected  I will purchase another one soon
__label__Positive	Very convenient and easy
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly  not sure how to rate a gift card  It was a gift for one of our church Christmas Angels

__label__Positive	for those of you who cant figure out what to get a person or for those pesky relatives that you dont know well enough to know what they are into this gift card will do the trick Once they have an amazon card they can buy anything from a cross or a pacifier to adult entertainment and gun parts
__label__Positive	The card came in a few days of ordering and the food at the Cheesecake Factory was delicious
__label__Positive	Convenient safe and consistent  Could be better if I recieved a gift card for a  back like I have at stores at xmas time

__label__Positive	Its money to spend whats not to like
__label__Positive	Easier to buy in a 10 pack and keep them around for any occasion
__label__Positive	Great gift 
__label__Positive	The person I gave it to loved it

__label__Positive	Nice gift for anyone
__label__Positive	Was a great idea for a gift so that the person can get whatever they want for thier birthday  Thanks
__label__Positive	fine no comentaries
__label__Negative	The product itself has nothing special It would be good to have an email confirmation once the gift card is delivered electronically My friend was traveling and cant check email very often I had to call her to make sure that she received this gift which partially ruined my surprise without calling her I had no info at all to show if the email was delivered or not
__label__Positive	Does this really need a review
__label__Positive	Comes with a nice birthday cupcake box Perfect for birthday gift
__label__Positive	Purchased as a gift I wish we had a Cheesecake Factory in the area
__label__Positive	Recommended 100
__label__Positive	My nephew loves getting Amazon gift cards  so that is what I get him for Christmas  birthdays  No buying gift cards from some place he may or may not like No wrapping presents and going to the post office  Easy Peezy
__label__Negative	I wont ever buy a fangango card again Your stuck using them for a local movie and when you have problems with their payment site they drain your card before using any allotted system credit and you cant go to the movie theatre to rectify Buy your local movie threatres gift cards most fo th time theyll be usable for a fandango ticket purchase anyway
__label__Positive	Loved the mini amazon box gift card holder
__label__Positive	I got my item quickly as promised I love buffalo wild wings so this was great to give to my friend
__label__Positive	I purchased this as a gift for Mothers Day and my mom loved the personalized card  She wouldnt normally tell others about a gift card she received but she told friends and family of how I sent a gift card with my picture  Its the little things that can make a huge difference
__label__Positive	good service fairly quick delivery the one thing I didnt appreciate was express sending me a letter trying to get me to use one of their credit cards this gift card was bought as a holiday gift
__label__Positive	Nice little tin holding giftcard
__label__Positive	Was a much appreciated get well gift  Really super presentation
__label__Positive	Excellent with the discount price

__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are the perfect gift Thousands of things to choose from
__label__Positive	item as expected
__label__Positive	Just as I would like an Amazon Gift Card so I often give the cards There is such a great choice of items at Amazon Every time I have given cards as gifts I have enjoyed the reaction as the receivers tell me what they plan to buy
__label__Positive	The gift certificate was given to my grandson for Christmas and was very much happy in getting it so he can buy more on Amazon which he love to do
__label__Positive	Comes in gift box
__label__Positive	An easy gift
__label__Positive	My mother loves her kindle She also has way too much stuff that she has accumulated over the years So for her birthday I gave her an Amazon gift card to buy more kindle books Instead of the run of the mill gift card this one had a picture of her with her granddaughter
__label__Positive	Perfect last minute yet personalized gift  Simple to create
__label__Positive	This was a gift
__label__Positive	I mean Its a gift card 5 stars for doing what its supposed to do you know letting you buy stuff
__label__Positive	Its super convenient quick and simple Perfect Thanks Amazon I will definitely be using this gift idea again in the future
__label__Positive	The gift card came within a week and I spent it within it one day  Absoultly no problems at all
__label__Positive	they were great
__label__Positive	A nice gift card for people that like Subway
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Fabulous idea for the person who has everything Feeds the Kindle Ebook habit too
__label__Positive	Easiest gift card to give and very much appreciated  Instant happiness when sent by email  Amazon made it even sweeter by offering a 10 off coupon for my next purchase
__label__Positive	Dont listen to any review that says the gift cards arent genuine they must have bought it from the wrong seller I received my gift card within two days and bought it when it was a prime deal I paid 40 for the 50 gift card

I verified that the balance is the correct claimed amount of 50 Buy with ease on Amazon Im very satisfied with this

1010 would buy again
__label__Positive	Bought this GC because there was a 10 promotional credit Even got the email saying it was applied to my account When I click the link in the email it says Im not eligible for the promotion Not cool Amazon
__label__Negative	Works well but when I order theres always like 5 something left over So a week or two later Ill go try to use up the remaining balance on my gift card and Its like No money left I think the egift cards expire after a little while This has happened multiple times Only buy if you expect to use it pretty soon I guess
__label__Negative	BE VERY CAREFUL  If you order cards of different denominations as I did Dont order them all in the snowflake tin because there is no easy way to sort which tin is for which amount They are individually shrinked wrapped with a covered claim code The 100 have the denomination labelled on the card but cant be identified without a call to Amazon with the serial number or removing the individual tin shrink wrap And even then the recipient you wont know the unlabelled card is for 25 Only after calling with the serial number and a long hold could I find out which were which ARRGGHHH  This is frustration plus wrapping especially for someone with arthritis  I  decided to return all the 25 cards
__label__Positive	Delivered on time and as described
__label__Positive	Gave this as a gift I have not eaten there but I have heard great things about it
__label__Positive	nice gift for a friend
__label__Positive	how can you go wrong
__label__Positive	Nothing to say its only a gift card and I have nothing to say except that  received on time and according my demand
__label__Positive	easy and convenient for giving as a bday gift or a wedding giftmy friend and her new husband received an amazon gift card which was pretty convenient
__label__Positive	Gift for a teen who knows what he wants to buy Always appreciated by the recipient
__label__Positive	Cute tin design for the gift card Makes the gift that much special
__label__Positive	Easy to order and EVERYONE loves them as a giftno matter the occasion
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an AMAZON gift card Perfect gift giving
__label__Positive	Went to the movies
__label__Positive	
__label__Negative	I never got it in the mail so I was one present short on Christmas morning
__label__Positive	Grandkids loved their gift cards They couldnt wait to call me and tell me what they ordered and when they received their gifts
__label__Positive	Huh
__label__Positive	Great Dirty Santa gives them something fight for
__label__Positive	Always a hit Amazon gift cards make the best gifts Everyone loves them and theyre very much appreciated
__label__Positive	Yay gift card
__label__Positive	As always the best gift to give when you are not sure what the receiver would like or already has
__label__Positive	My granddaughter devours books on her Kindle  Nice gift for her any time but especially on her birthday  This is an easy and efficient way to get money for book purchases from the great Amazon selection
__label__Positive	I love the idea of sending a gift card  My complaint about the process is that it said the cards would be sent within 15 minutes  However since I had to set up a new account the entire process took over 4 hours  I had to call in to check to see what caused the delay  There was no disclaimer about a possible delay  Perhaps for future customers you might want to full disclose that bit on information
__label__Positive	These are great for small gifts for customers I put one in a card and everyone is thrilled to get them
__label__Positive	Excellent  Fantastic Deal  Super Prices Thank You
__label__Positive	I love the way this card is presented  My granddaughter will love it
__label__Positive	Great package for the Gift Cards  A nice XMas touch for giving out the Amazon Gift Cards Who wouldnt use an Amazon Gift Card
__label__Positive	Super happy the card arrived in less than a day ordered Monday around 4 PM arrived Tuesday by 5 PM Giving this to my niece as part of her stocking for the holiday
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Positive	It was perfect
__label__Positive	When it works its great  Cute cupcake or other little tin easy gift easy to order always a happy recipient  Ive used this service before without any problem However in this instance somehow the requested gift note did not make it into the package and the recipient had no idea that the gift was from me and had to ask around  A bit of a letdown on that score Otherwise everything was great  Speedy delivery etc
__label__Positive	gift
__label__Positive	Worked at Lane Bryant  Thanks
__label__Positive	Shipped fast worked perfectly
__label__Positive	This didnt get a 5  because the way you have to fold it becomes cumbersome if you use heavier paper  I used a regular printer paper and when I folded it it tore a bit  My fussiness didnt appreciate that
__label__Positive	Delayed delivery but it was the fault of the USPS Otherwise we love ice cream
__label__Positive	MOTHER IN LAW LOVED THE GIFT
__label__Positive	The perfect gift
__label__Positive	It was just a gift card but got quickly in email and so easy to redeem will get again if I need to
__label__Positive	Ordering this item was the perfect birthday gift for my nephew By giving an amazon gift card I avoided buying him something he would not want
__label__Negative	Cant use itreturn

__label__Positive	Very practical and fast
__label__Positive	A hit for a teenager gift
__label__Positive	This was purchased as a Christmas gift and was glad to recommend Olive Garden to my nephew and his family as it is one of the best places to enjoy a great Italian meal  Would purchase again to introduce someone to a good restaurant if they have never been there
__label__Negative	Does not work

__label__Positive	Hmm not sure how to comment for gift cards except to say that I love being able to order online it ships securely and easy to me and I dont have to wait in line at a store
__label__Negative	DO NOT PURCHASE A FANDAGO GIFT CARD BEFORE READING THIS I received 31500 gift cards over the holidays from a wonderful young couple who know I love going to the movies They were excited to give me what they thought was a great gift I could use to buy tickets popcorn drinks etcat the movie theater When I arrived at the theater to use my card I was told by the box office that Fandango gift cards CAN ONLY BE USED TO BUY MOVIE TICKETS ONLINE AND NOTHING ELSE I was angry and disappointed After the long drive home I went to the Fandango website to buy a ticket for the next days movie As I suspected there was an additional 135 Convenience Fee for each ticket purchased My 725 Senior Citizen ticket becomes an 860 ticket THERE SHOULD BE A HUGE DISCLAIMER ON THESE GIFT CARDS THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE USED TO PURCHASE MOVIE TICKETS ONLINE AND THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL CONVENIENCE FEE ADDED TO THE PRICE OF EACH TICKET Better yet these ripoff gift cards should not be sold online or anywhere else I feel worse for the young couple who gave me the gift cards than I do for myself 4500 is a lot of money for them and they thought it was such a wonderful gift I am beyond furious
__label__Negative	Gift card for australian use Recipiant  unable to  procur books   My friend is an avid reader and  this was for her birthday   Very disappointing
__label__Negative	Very upset I gave this to my sister for Christmas She just now went to use it today and they told her it has 0 on the card and she was not able to use it at all It says its passed the day of return but honestly I trusted Amazon enough not to rip me off and should still get a refund since not only did she get stuck with an unexpected bill but she had to deal with the embarrassment of trying to pay with a 0 gift card It was suppose to have 50 I am livid
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	I was lucky enough to get this during a lightning deal It arrived very quickly and I cant wait to use it Thanks
__label__Positive	What can I say  Amazon gift cards are the best  They allow those you love to choose what they want from this site  Whats better than that  The possibilities are endless
__label__Positive	Came in very clean ready to give as a gift Thank you
__label__Positive	Perfect for occasion and recipient
__label__Positive	They were bright and animated very cute
__label__Positive	You buy this as a gift for someone else and they get 50 Amazon credit  You shouldnt buy one of these for yourself because you can just buy things directly for yourself from Amazon
__label__Positive	I sent this as a birthday gift to our sons fiance 27 and she loved it Shes going to use the cupcake tin for a piece of jewelry
__label__Positive	Perfect thank you

__label__Positive	Cant beat that deal 25 for a 25 White Castle gift card
__label__Positive	Fun presentation of gift card  personally I find gift cards distasteful but sometimes they are the best option  At least I can give them in a cute package
__label__Positive	My kids are grown up and away from home As I do not know what they would want on special occasions the Amazon Gift Card is the only way to go Anything they  want they can find on Amazon and at the best price
__label__Positive	I always told my brother I was going to get him a lump of coal for christmas I finally did HA  At least this one had some value though o

__label__Positive	Finally used my card from 6 months ago yesterday  40 got me 50 and it worked smoothly
__label__Positive	Its a gift card  you know it was loved
__label__Neutral	I was excited to find out that I could have this git card shipped to me next day However I was really disappointed when I received it because it was not handled properly during delivery and the card was bent and creased I had to take the gift card off of the card and throw the card away because it was not presentable

The packaging was not sufficient for the contents My suggestion would be to encase the card inside of a cardboard sleeve and package it in a cardboard envelope similar to what other carriers use

Amazon has been so great with all of the packages I have bought over the last few weeks so I was really surprised how careless this package was treated
__label__Positive	perfecto
__label__Positive	Always a wonderful gift for that hard to buy for person They can get exactly what they want in  just about any area at Amazon

__label__Positive	Love the choices of cards and how quick it is to print out  Would do it again
Recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Excellent Gift Card
__label__Negative	Took 2 tries for the gift card to be sent and then after the second try it took almost 2 weeks before it was sent  This meant the gift was not received for almost exactly 1 month
__label__Positive	Amazons Online Gift Cards Are Sent To you Quickly  Within 5 Minutes Or Less Are Accurate Easy To Use And Never Expire

__label__Positive	I gave this as a gift to my mom And she loved it Recently she bought herself some books that shes been wanting
__label__Positive	Some readers had problems with the card but I sent it to my Mom who is ok with computers at 80 she is a down right genus in her age group and she had no issues at all She lives far away and cant get out to the stores this was a blessing to her because now she can read as much as she wants not just the free books

__label__Positive	Great gift Got it for our Christmas party love the saying
__label__Negative	I ordered an Amazon gift card Friday that was to be delivered the next day for someones birthday It did not get there until Tuesday after the birthday and of all things was left in a carport and not in the mailbox  They would have never known it was there if it had not been mentioned online in my order history  Very frustrating when you have an 11 year old waiting for his gift
__label__Positive	Choosing an Amazon Gift Card for Family Friends and Coworkers is the best way to shop It is easy always promptly delivered and always received well by the recipient Upon ordering an Amazon Gift Card Amazon provides tracking and delivery notifications to the purchaser Amazon Gift Cards are always high on my gift giving list as well as my suggestion to Family and Friends for Holiday giving An Amazon Gift Card provides so many shopping opportunities to the recipient of the gift card My Family always looks forward to receiving an Amazon Gift Card at Holiday Time I love gifting an Amazon Gift Card for every occasion
__label__Positive	The Amazon Birthday Gift Card is for a very special occasion This belongs to my nephew and he likes it
__label__Positive	I was very pleased with the print  It was very clear and I printed it on a beige colored card quality paper and it looked great  I was in a bind the day that I needed to buy my gift card and had no time to run and buy a card so this worked out perfect for me
__label__Positive	Some people are saying this is working for them but every time I get one it works perfectly
__label__Positive	What can I sayyou cant go wrong with gift cards Especially Amazonthey always have something for everyone Gift box was nice too

__label__Positive	Fast
__label__Positive	I know people think gift cards are so impersonal and even thoughtless  I did too  But with the economy being the way it is I have to watch every single penny  I like to give gifts that people will use and enjoy  These gift cards are perfect for the person that has everything and likes to shop online  We all love shopping on Amazon and it feels good to have a dollar to spend on something you like or want and know that this company will take real good care of you  Its the way to go
__label__Positive	Easy to access Recipient very pleased This is a wonderful gift for someone whose tastes you are not sure of
__label__Negative	Do yourself a favor  buy an Amazoncom gift card at the grocery store or have it delivered via email  The tracking on my order says the card was signed for but it sure wasnt signed for by anyone I knew  I think it was delivered to the front door and left then who knows what happened to it  Im on my second phone call to Amazon to resolve this and still no refund  I love Amazoncom and do most of my shopping through them so I hope someone can resolve this
__label__Positive	Easy

__label__Negative	Was not activated
__label__Positive	I received the gift card earlier then expected  I checked the balance when it arrived and it was for the correct amount  I had no trouble at all redeeming the gift card at the restaurant about a week later
__label__Neutral	Great alternative to a gift card but widely unpopular with the cashiers Ive met with  A manager was needed on both occasions that I used this product to verify which took awhile  In other words purchase the actual gift card if youre one of those people who seem to always be in a rush

Perfect gift for college kids in need of groceries
__label__Positive	Yup its a gift card Quick shipping
__label__Neutral	Nice
__label__Negative	Ordered for my moms birthday It came torn and bent I am disappointed and it doesnt look like a gift card I would want to give

__label__Positive	yup It is a gift card
__label__Positive	Excellent wedding gift for a computer savvy couple
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are great  In fact it is one of my favorite gifts to receive  The only down side is that it cant be used for some items n Amazon  That is disappointing sometimes but usually not a big problem

__label__Positive	Perfect Gift
__label__Positive	great gift idea
__label__Positive	One of my friends was ONLY registered at Amazoncom for her baby shower and I was unsure of what exactly she needed The day of the shower I realized I still had no gift and was obligated to be at two other gettogethers that morning with three yearold twins in tow So I went on Amazon to purchase a gift card I was unsure if it had to ship because I didnt have her email address The facebook delivery option saved the day She used her gift card to get her dream stroller and everyone is happy 
__label__Negative	gift card did not work for recipient every gift card i sent for xmas is coming up with the same issue incredibly embarrassing and un amazon like DO NOT ORDER GIFT CARDS THROUGH AMAZON 
__label__Positive	Purchased for my granddaughter  see loved it
__label__Positive	What can I say about a gift card
__label__Negative	You can only use 3 forms of payment when buying a ticket from southwest Their corporate office is rude and unhelpful even though the back of the card say they take 4 forms of payment
__label__Positive	Loved that it came wrapped for me
__label__Positive	The egift card worked as expected
__label__Positive	The recipient enjoyed it
__label__Positive	like it
__label__Positive	Very nice quality tin makes it much better to give and shows some thought  Instead of the easy route I actually took in locating a gift
__label__Positive	Bought this for mu husband who loves Amazon great gift for someone who enjoys all the things of value on Amazon
__label__Positive	excelente
__label__Positive	Excelenteeee
__label__Positive	Remember when it was so much fun to shop for our grandchildren when they were young  Once they become teenagers and above all they want is moneyI do give them the equivalent in money or gift cards to what I would have spent on toys etc I just have to find creative ways to wrap it up as gifts  This Subway card will go to a grandson who is a Subway Junkie  He is attending college and there is a Subway near his dorm  I put this particular card in a jar full of dry beans  The gift will be heavier and he will not be able to see the card right away  Hmmmmnow how will I disguise his other gifts cards and money
__label__Positive	It was a simple experience Not much to say but it works 
__label__Positive	What I would get I would stock my pantry and cupboards with paleo goodness Then of course a Vitamix new kitchen utensils and some perfume for me
__label__Positive	Always a  quick and easy fix for the quick gift I downloaded the card and tucked  it into the birthday card for my Grandsons
girlfriend She was so pleased with the card and the fact she could go to Amazon and find so many choices A real plus for all
concerned
__label__Positive	I ordered this for a Christmas gift  This is for my sister who has a Kindle and she will be able to order books etc with it
__label__Neutral	Why does it take so long for you to complete your obligations The gift card I purchased was purchased about 1 month ago and it took that long to get the 10 credit It didnt take that long for you to take the purchase price from my account
__label__Positive	Ideal gift Pretty card Sent and received quickly from UK to USA Thanks
__label__Positive	The easy way to give a gift  And faster
__label__Positive	Our friend thoroughly enjoyed being able to pick out her own gift  How can you go wrong with your own choice
__label__Positive	why do they make these things so easy to buy but with the most impossible packaging  Seriously it is so hard to open up these files  they are IN the computer
__label__Positive	Enjoyed it very much She loves Hoops and YoYo Thank you for keeping a good many available to send for all occasions
__label__Positive	nice and convenient
__label__Positive	Perfect case for a birthday

It is a very nice concept It also informs us whether the friend redeemed it or not So thats a good feature
__label__Negative	I was expecting this gift card to be plastic like a normal gift card  Instead it is just a piece of thick paper
__label__Positive	Great gift My dad loved it
__label__Positive	My gift message was not included with my order so my recipient did not know who it was from
__label__Neutral	The cards arrived fine  It was disappointing that I could not order more  When you have a few children involved and want each to have a card its hard to explain to them why they cant have their own from Amazon  I will just go to the theater next time to get what I want
__label__Positive	This gift card came with a good selection of cards and was easy and convenient to print out Nice to not have a fee like Visa and AmEx gift cards
__label__Positive	Great Gift idea
__label__Positive	Perfect gift and so easy to purchase it

__label__Positive	Cant go wrong
__label__Positive	What to say about a gift card It arrived quickly and the free packaging was very nice
__label__Positive	Always an ontime gift
__label__Positive	my sons Christmas present  he loved it He does all his shopping on amazon Easy for me too
__label__Positive	This is a wonderful way to give a gift certificate to a loved one  This is easy and when you forget to get a present or something you can do it right away  Prints and folds into a card in minutes
__label__Neutral	Difficult to open
__label__Positive	This is the perfect gift for those hard to shop for individuals that you just love to death but cant seem to find any one specific thing they will actually enjoy So let them decide Also the upload your photo option is a very nice way to add a personal touch The best part is you dont have to leave home to acquire it provided you have a printer full of ink
__label__Positive	Perfect for Employee gifts
__label__Positive	Made a hit
__label__Positive	its a nice idea if you actually send it Had trouble sending it to her but we got it worked out thx
__label__Positive	Bought as a gift  Arrived as promised

__label__Positive	I would recommend this gift card to ANYONE The recipient will appreciate it very much because they can buy themselves anything on Amazon to the value of the gift card Amazon also has gift cards for birthdays You can even email the gift card to the recipient The person I gave this to lived interstate  unfortunately I wasnt going to see them at xmas so I posted it to them but as I said earlier you can also email gift cards to recipients It was sooooo easy to purchase Took only a few minutes  the recipient loved it Highly recommended
__label__Positive	Gift box was different and was enjoyed by person as a gift
__label__Positive	Works great everytime
__label__Negative	If you expect this to get to the recipient in a reasonable amount of time just print or email the gift card One day ship is nonsense This took a week to get delivered I would not buy this again It would be extremely less frustrating to give cash in a nice card instead
__label__Positive	quick delivery great gift
__label__Positive	What a convenient way to give a gift  Very easy way to give someone something they can use for what they want
__label__Positive	so easy the recipient can get whatever they want
__label__Positive	Such a pretty looking card 3
__label__Positive	got a special on these spend 50 and get a 10 credit I shop often on amazon so I took advantage of the deal The gift card holders in the Egg are cute bigger than expected but that is a good thing when placing them in Easter baskets 
__label__Positive	Works great for what I need it for  It is not a vacuum cleaner but at our cabin which is off the grid it is great for picking up crumbs etc so that we dont have to turn on the generator to run our vacuum  Love it
__label__Positive	SPOTIFY
__label__Positive	Bought these recently for two birthdays  They are so much cuter than what you see in the grocery stores
Plus who doesnt like getting an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	If I ever receive bank gift cards nonmerchant specific gift cards I almost always use them to buy Amazon gift cards so I can use the money on Amazon I love how I can buy Amazon email gift cards in any amount so if Ive used part of a bank gift card at another store and have a small odd amount left on it I can still use it for an Amazon email gift card Very userfriendly  I like all the fun designs even though I just send them to myself
__label__Positive	Quickly delivered no shipping chargesall gift No tax Couldnt attend the wedding and bring a gift in person Next best thing to bringing a gift
__label__Positive	The card is happy colourful and expresive of the right emotion

__label__Positive	Simple and easy gift to give  Perfect
__label__Positive	Very pleased

__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards take the strain out of gifts for grandchildren that live across the country It insures they recieve something they want
__label__Positive	Son wanted shoes I had no idea what shoes So much easier for him to get exactly what he wants The only stipulation I had was he tell me what he ordered so I new that he ordered the shoes
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Easy way to give
__label__Positive	This arrived on time and just like the picture shows It was so cute in the box that I didnt have to wrap it Some people say they hate gift cards but I love them because who doesnt love free money My friend loves Amazon and loves money like me lol so this was the perfect gift for her to spend a little without having to spend her own
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Exactly what you expect
__label__Positive	it was a gift
__label__Negative	The recipient of this ecard must sign up for Amazon to redeem I feel this is something that should have been disclosed upon purchasing but it was not I did not like the fact of giving a gift that forced someone to become a member just to redeem  Also I set a date for it to be delivered because it was for a birthday and then it sent 15 minutes after ordering I canceled it and sent a physical gift card that will allow the recipient to be just a customer and not forced into being a member
__label__Positive	My 81 year old mother reads her kindle every day and she appreciated this gift card far more than another useless dozen roses on her birthday
__label__Positive	My children loved the soup

__label__Positive	Perfect Gift Card and Greeting Card for Christmas No mistakes going this route when someone wants to buy from Amazon
__label__Positive	This card is precious and the recipients loved it I think it sets just the right tone for Christmas It was my favorite and I would use it again
__label__Negative	This item had false advertisement In the description this was clearly posted AMC Gift Cards are good for both movies and concessions at any theatre in the United States so I purchased this as a gift for a family member across country Ends up that you have to read the LEGAL DISCLAIMER to find out that NO it is not good for every theatre in the US JUST THEIR THEATRES This was embarrassing and very inconvenient I would HIGHLY recommend NOT buying this gift card unless you know for sure that your theatre takes it
__label__Positive	Easy way to give a great birthday gift on Amazoncom
__label__Positive	I sent a Amazon Gift Card to my wife for her birthday this year She is a person that is hard to buy for because most of the time when she is wanting something she will come to Amazon and order the product When I seen this Gift Card from Amazon I knew it would be the best way to let her shop Amazon for the perfect gift She loved it

__label__Positive	Good
__label__Negative	This doesnt deserve two stars but I dont like that one star said I hate it so I went with two
I sent this gift card via email to my sister so it could be used for my nieces birthday but she says she never received it She swears she never received any email that said it was from me so I dont know if it was just from Amazon and went to spam or what I emailed her the confirmation information that I received and she was told that wasnt enough information to issue a new one
Now my money is lost in limbo somewhere Not happy
__label__Positive	I love being able to use my own photos on gift cards  Makes the gift more meaningful

__label__Positive	It is very nice to also have a greeting card included It is one less thing to worry about Stamped it and mailed it  Done
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	The other negative reviews citing the surprising limits of the card are correct Here are the terms from the Marriott website

Marriott TravelCards may be used within the Marriott portfolio of brands including participating retail spa golf food and beverage outlets Card is a prepaid card not a credit card and is property of and issued by MI Fulfillment Services LLC Protect card like cash This card does not expire Each transaction will be debited against card balance if transaction exceeds balance user must pay the difference Card is not redeemable for cash and change will not be returned except where otherwise required by applicable law Card becomes inactive upon use of all card value Card cannot be applied to group special corporatenegotiated catering associate or other discountednoncommissionable rates Card cannot be used when reservation is booked by a travel agent or other third party Card cannot be used to secure or confirm a reservation Marriott Rewards points cannot be earned with the use of this card Lost stolen or damaged cards will be replaced only if previously registered Value of replaced card will equal balance on card at the time it was reported lost stolen or damaged To check card balance and see complete terms and conditions visit giftsmarriottcom or call 18004426132 Use of this card confirms acceptance of terms above

Youll notice

1 Theres no discount for purchasing the card nor an incentive for buying ie 5 added to the balance
2 You CANNOT pay for any negotiated group or corporate rate This means you can only use it to pay the HIGHEST published rate
3 You CANNOT use it on a booking made by a travel agents OBT online booking tool or booked by a travel agent
4 You will receive NO Marriott rewards points for your stay when payment is made with the card
5 The card cannot be used to make an online booking But when you make a nondiscounted reservation you CAN indeed pay with the gift card
6 After you get angry and realize you cannot use the card for anything except NONDISCOUNTED rates Marriott will not allow you to have your money returned

As a personal note from an individual thats me who travels over 200 days a year such restrictive terms are insulting The benefit to ANY company of offering a gift card is cash up front It is guaranteed revenue and the NO REFUND policy is to be expected But of course that assumes the card can be used under reasonable terms This card cannot My experience with this card was as a gracious reciprocation from a family member 500 as thanks for help with a business issuea generous gift which I cannot use

What is bothersome is that last year my stays totaled approx 14600USD at Marriott properties I have a great corporate rate through my employer and also use negotiated rates available to my clients as well when they book for my stays in relation to a business meeting These discounted rates are often as much as 40 off the published nondiscounted tariff So Marriott has the revenue up front loaded on the card But in order to use it I have to forgo discounts available to me for being a good customer Also they refuse to provide me with Rewards points which if you know anything about the chain is a loss of benefit and service as a guest

You can probably tell from my comments this issue has me fired up and spurred me to write a letter to the Marriott Intl Inc Simply put Marriott is a great organization provides great properties and really tries to make you comfortable As a Platinum member Ive had great experiences at their properties especially at the JW locations But this is a BAD product My letter was sent eleven days ago and Ill post the response once its received
__label__Positive	Delivered on time
__label__Positive	Always makes a great gift
__label__Positive	its a gift card love how they have sales to save 10 came just as shown in the mail cant wait to use it

__label__Positive	Who will ever look at the review for a gift card  Not sure what to say it can be used to buy stuff at amazon and afterwards you can you give them to the kids who will play with them for 10 minutes and then hide them in their room  A few months later you will find it and wonder if their is any money left on them

__label__Negative	I am extremely disappointed that 50 is the only denomination that this card comes in  It was by far my favorite and because of the fact that I needed 25  75 I must choose something else  Please make this available in multiple denominations next year
__label__Positive	Great 
__label__Positive	What to buy for a teenager  I think its best when he can get what he wants and Amazon has so much to pick from
__label__Positive	Such a fun wonderful restaurant the staff is very accommodating Food is excellent and I will definitely be a repeat customer
__label__Neutral	The navy pockets were attractive thick and sturdy but the thin silver  white butchers twine was easily unraveled and fell apart  I had a few tags fall off my gift bags which I then had to reattach using other means
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Negative	It wouldnt print the whole code Had to pencil the rest in
__label__Positive	Whats not to love about an Amazon Gift Card  My grand niece looks forward to spending it
__label__Positive	I sent it as gift and the recipient was thrilled with itwill be getting his wife one soon for her birthday
__label__Positive	Always a winner
__label__Positive	I get GREAT food and save money at the same time Win Win for me

__label__Positive	I was worried but it got here fine and worked very well
__label__Positive	Absolutely the best way to gift
__label__Positive	I love the gift cards as they make my purchases so much easier
My family find them a great ideal present for me as I purchase so many books for my kindle
__label__Positive	In case anyone wanted to know there is no expiration date anywhere on the card or on the packaging The card worked fine at my Regal Theatre
__label__Positive	Does exactly what it sets out to do

I chose to send my gift card via email and heard that it arrived within an hour Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Easy and safe to send
__label__Positive	I love giving my kids gift cards to get shoes for the grandkids It lets them take the kids shopping and them pick out what they want and the money actually goes to shoes

__label__Positive	Ships quickly and no problems with purchase
__label__Neutral	The gift card itself was fine But Red Lobster is very hard to find in LA and quite pricy
__label__Positive	Not an instant delivery if you order a larger amount Also keep in mind sephora limits 2 gift cards on their website and since there is a 100 limit on amazon this can cause issues
__label__Positive	Gave some choices to a teen thats hard to shop he enjoys his kindle e reader now with new options
__label__Positive	Ships super fast and its the perfect gift for teenagers or anyone who loves amazon

__label__Positive	The convenience fee is annoying if youre not buying tickets for a movie you actually expect to be sold out like on a premier night or something Im glad I bought Beauty and the Beast tickets in advance though because it was sold out when I got to the theater Fandango is just nice and easy to use
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like gift cards  Process is easy

__label__Positive	Was a gift to give
__label__Positive	I used it as a gift for a birthday party
__label__Positive	At first I was disappointed Oh great another gift card
So I logged in and started shopping This was the first
Time I had ever used an online gift card
I was soon set at ease when I had seen how easy
It relly was One of the great features is that your
Remaining balance is saved This means it automatily
Uses the gift card for purchases until  its funds are depleted

  Great very easy to use
__label__Positive	Exactly what I ordered Arrived quickly Purchased this for Christmas gifts Has already been used with no problems whatsoever Receiver loved it

__label__Positive	I have nothing really to say about the Amazon Kindle card Its just more convenient to get it online than have to drive to a store
__label__Positive	The photo didnt arrive with the recipient properly centered as it looked on my screen when creating it but the gift card function worked well and was otherwise as expected
__label__Positive	A family member had asked for something but was not specific about the flavor  Purchasing a Gift Card from amazon ensured he got exactly what he wanted
__label__Positive	An easy was to give to someone for their special day
__label__Positive	This was very easy to order I like the gift card option of the Happy Birthday as a banner towed behind a biplane
I would recommend this to anyone wanting to give a gift card to someone for their birthday Everyone loves Amazon Plus free shipping whats not to like

__label__Positive	Yes  Very much appreciated
__label__Positive	muy bueno 100 recomendado
__label__Positive	It would be great if there was a way to have a Amazon print a message inside the card I forgot to tell my sister I was sending it and she spent over an hour on the phone with an Amazon employee trying to figure out who it was who sent it to her whoops  I included a gift note but apparently it didnt make it into the box

Other than that its incredibly convenient to have a card and a gift card sent to someone this easily Thank you Amazon 
__label__Positive	Exactly as advertised
__label__Positive	I ordered this gift card on a Wednesday and my sister received it the VERY next day  I LOVE AMAZON PRIME  If you dont have Amazon Prime your life isnt as easy as it could be
__label__Positive	Convenient gift
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards make gift giving so easy Got this one as a gift for a birthday and the receiver was so happy with it They shopped from their easy chair at home for items they wanted instead of me buying them something they didnt like or need It was a wonderful idea and will be used more in the future
__label__Neutral	Good option as a gift but it would be better if offers what we get doesnt have a validity period like your gift cards The 10 offer for 50 Is only valid about 2 months and cant be applied to any product

__label__Positive	Great Came on time and worked Thats all I needed

__label__Positive	I bought  it for a special couple as a thank you I looked everywhere  in my town for a Saltgrass gift card bc I had heard them say how much they loved eating their steak but they hardly got to go I
couldnt  find one anywhere I know my friends were  going near one the following weekend  Amazon came thru for me and in plenty of time They loved their special gift and bragged of their wonderful  flavorful tender steaks Thanks Saltgrass and a big thank you to Amazon
__label__Positive	great around christmas
__label__Positive	A gift card is a great gift for someone who is an avid Kendle user It gives the reader the option yo buy many books
__label__Positive	100 RECOMENDADO
__label__Positive	Most everyone shops Amazon and the variety of products they sell mean they have something your recipient will want for themselves
__label__Positive	No magic with this order  
__label__Positive	No issues Good buy
__label__Positive	muy Bueno excelente metodo para comprar muy seguro excelente efectiva forma de pago cumplio todas mis expectativas muy bueno no tengo quejas
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for a helpful neighbor
__label__Positive	The gift was fine However we could not get the card to print correctly so we had to kind of make it work It did not look very professionalI wish there were better or more obvious instructions on how to make it print correctly
__label__Positive	Great thanks
__label__Positive	Card did what is expected the restaurant where I used it was disappointing sadly apparently a common experience with this restaurantly nowadays
__label__Positive	Love this for blog give aways So easy and convenient I will use it again for blog and podcast giveaways
__label__Positive	So I ordered 7 of these  I spend quite a bit each year on Amazon  so why not get some free Teddy Bears

1 Amazon Gift Card
Amazon gift cards  can never have enough Amazon credit  Out of all the types of gift cards you can give or receive as a gift Amazon is pretty close to receiving cash

2 Teddy Bear
Never was into the whole teddy bear collecting thing but now that I have 7 teddy bears I guess Im a teddy bear collector

Amazon should have more promotional items with gift cards
__label__Positive	It satisfied my birthday boy
__label__Positive	I purchased this gift card as a Christmas gift for my nephew I was very impressed with the box and bow It is very professional looking not cutesy
__label__Positive	What a great greeting card that came along with the gift card  Amazon made it easy to give a great gift and saved me a trip to purchase a card
__label__Positive	Id like to buy more 
__label__Positive	I have used this site many times and it is always perfect
__label__Positive	This is the perfect gift delivery system for a relative stationed on a ship at Sasebo Japan It went thru FaceBook  Used this to help two other relatives get gifts delivered for Christmas Will repeat this process for as long as deployment lasts
__label__Positive	This was super easy and made me very happy What a great thank you gift who wouldnt love to get an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Was perfect for giving my boss his Xmas gift
__label__Positive	Love the colors and the thickness of it  I wanted it for a trip so I did not have to carry my whole billfold it will work just fine
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Delivered to my friend the day I selected and she was thrilled
__label__Positive	Easy and appreciated
__label__Positive	Great gift it was much appreciated
__label__Positive	I sent this to a recent winner of a giveaway on my blog and it couldnt have been any easier  Just type in their email the amount you want to send your preferred payment method and youre done

My recipient got it within minutes and even sent me a thankyou via the form that was attached to the gift card  I have sent a ton of these gift cards in the past and they are probably one of my favorite ways to send someone a gift  They are also great if you forgot someones birthday

I really like that Amazon sends me a confirmation email that it has been sent but I do wish I would get some sort of notification that the recipient redeemed the gift card  I dont always get a thank you note in return from my recipient when they go to apply the card to their account
__label__Positive	I didnt know it was an animated card when I bought it When it was opened by the recipient they told me how much they liked it
__label__Negative	Double transaction due to mis representation of failed transaction
__label__Positive	Sometimes you dont know what a person really wantsso its much easier to give a gift card to a place they buy from than give something that wont be read or used
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Neutral	Didnt keep the  2nd email  re the code so had to get help from Customer service on that  I  should have read it all better or maybe you could have  set it up to be more important
__label__Positive	If your printer works your in good shape lol
__label__Positive	Easy gift giving to someone that uses Amazon on a regular basis especially someone that is hard to buy for
__label__Positive	great stocking stuffers
__label__Negative	good morning the day December 30 2010 I made a purchase of 3 gift card for a total of 380 dollars the problem is do not put my email address to receive the code but instead put my address in Miami locker  my question is I can reverse this purchase and it again but this time I want the code of the gift card arrived in my email please if you could do this operation today would greatly appreciate it since I live in Venezuela and is now due my share of dollars and do not want to lose them thanks

__label__Positive	I ordered it  It was delivered on time  Everyone was happy  The box was cute  What more could you ask for
__label__Positive	While the cardboard packing material isnt world class the card itself more than makes up for anything that it is lacking True to its word it is worth exactly the price advertised on the packaging The thick plastic card is very well made and able to withstand many environmental elements commonly found in any gamers every day life Moms washer and that 10 year old condom you never had the chance to use will not cause this card to be less valuable while stored in your wallet Cant go wrong buying this for any die hard game fan

__label__Positive	Gift for Christmas very cute

__label__Positive	Great idea
__label__Positive	Very cute
__label__Positive	I needed just a little something to add to a gift Id mailed and this worked perfectly  I highly recommend it
__label__Positive	Just let other posters have said you have to enter 600 before the rest of the numbers on the gift card I have no idea why it doesnt say that on the card Ive been trying to redeem it online for weeks until I saw these reviews Sure enough I entered 600 and was able to redeem right away For a second I thought I received a dud gift cards but that was not the case I hope my review helps other out Good luck
__label__Positive	Great and immediate service as always from Amazon
__label__Positive	The card was beautiful
__label__Negative	It never worked I keep trying to get this straightened out and they still havent given credit to my sons account
__label__Positive	Always trying to find a reasonable price for Christmas cards without going out the day after Christmas to find a good deal Decent cards for a good price
__label__Positive	Best last minute gift And love these card options need more please
__label__Positive	I was shocked to find out that my 350 dollar gift certificate was able to be redeemed for 350 no more no less  I dont know how many times Ive bought a gift card and the value redeemed was 25 50 even 100 less than I paid  It can definitely make for an awkward encounter the next time I see the gift recipient  No more thanks to Amazons high quality gift cards
__label__Positive	fast
__label__Positive	An email delivery gift card works just the same as a regular gift card  it just gets delivered faster

__label__Positive	Thakns Amazon I like the way theyre making it easy to gift someone when you dont have a chance to meet them 
__label__Negative	TERRIBLE  TERRIBLE  SAD  I didnt want to give it a star but I had to but this is a person is stealing the hard work of a man who worked his whole life to be a successful writer but people like this author cant come up with their own stuff so they steal the title and name of the author and their famous book to get people to buy theirs and call it a summary  Shame on you  Im not sure how you sleep at night knowing you are stealing from a man who has now passed away and his children  Wow
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	Great and easy to claim
__label__Positive	Gave these as Christmas gifts and they were great Everyone loved them They need to be redeemed before you start shopping just follow the directions on the card to redeem them

What more can I say
__label__Positive	Easy fast and the perfect gift

__label__Positive	It is what it is  When you can get this using prime and it is one of the deals of the day or a lightning deal it is like free money  You can also use this with your customer loyalty discount or another coupon to really save money  Even when it is not on sale it makes a good gift for a sibling or parent  The packaging fits nicely into a birthday sized card

__label__Negative	I ordered two gift cards on Dec 16 with free overnight shipping  Shipped to my Mom for safekeeping  They got lost told after I called two days later  Refund was supposed to be to my cc never happened  I was told to reorder which I did again with free overnight shipping  They did arrive as promised which is why I didnt rate it one star  On Christmas I found out that my original gift card order was refunded as a gift card one for the total amount of the two and mailed to the shipping recipient my Mom instead of to me  Thank goodness she was confused by the gift card and brought it to me to look at  What a screw up
__label__Positive	This is an incredibly convenient way to shopand the card that printed out was so cute

__label__Positive	Was a great Xmas present and was well received Saved a lot of time running around from store to store and the hassle of fighting the crowds
__label__Positive	I dont think this need a review is a perfect gift
__label__Neutral	Amazon needs to proofread much more closely before sending out custom things like this to its customers  I had carefully worded a gift note to be included with this gift card but when I got it I could hardly read it it was faded and blurry as if the ink was low in the printer  The invoice accompanying it was the same way  Since our printer at home was not working at the time I ended up having to rewrite my note onto the card myself which is unfortunate since my handwriting is not all that great  Very disappointed in this fact and their only response when calling to voice my concern was to tell me theyd send that department a note no apology of any kind
__label__Positive	It is a gift card it does what its supposed to do
__label__Positive	The was a gift for a relative She loved it  A great gift to celebrate a birthday
__label__Positive	Love Hoops and Yoyo Gift cards are a great way to give a gift that allows the recipient to get whatever they want

__label__Positive	Arrived Via email in less than 2 minutes  The picture is great and should stay as a choice year round
__label__Positive	These are so needed for the gift cards for my grand kids  I dont get out too often and it was great to be able to order them online  They are very pretty and fit the need
__label__Negative	Bought this for my father and when he went to redeem it someone else had already used it Contacting Amazon has been of no help They just say they will look into it and get back to me in 2448 hours Its been over a week now since my last correspondence and I havent heard a thing back They dont give you a complaint number or anything either so when you try to reply to check on it you have to go through the whole process with someone new and they tell you the same thing the last person did

Heed the warnings from all the people saying they bought a card and an unknown person redeemed it Amazon will not help you I saw the same warnings and ignored them because I figured I could count on Amazon if anything happened I was wrong I wish I could give this less than one star
__label__Positive	VERY cute tin for this gift card  Will definitely keep the tin and it was so much nicer than just a gift card in an envelope  Thank you Amazon
__label__Positive	It did the job 
__label__Positive	Perfect gift all in one Thank you
__label__Positive	I purchased this gift card when it was on sale as theres a local store near us that my husband likes but I was less sold on It was delivered really quickly perhaps even next day and Ive kept it for a few months  well we used it today with no problems  On a side note I actually really liked what I had today so the stock is up on Buffalo Wild Wings for me 
__label__Positive	Convenient versatile and sensitive to receivers desires Why give something the recipient may not enjoy Id prefer to think of the receiver than my own status when gift giving and I am unsure of what they would really like to have
__label__Positive	These are awesome Xmas gifts for my son and soninlaws for Xmas as Applebees has the best food
__label__Positive	Great way to send a quick birthday card  All love it
__label__Positive	Kids love the Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	I was delighted to find that I could download and print Amazon gift cards from my home computer  I was able to choose from lots of designs include my own personal message and select any amount I wanted to spend  The recipients were quite excited about their gifts also  While Im not usually a fan of giving gift cards because they seem a bit impersonal Im pretty sure this wont be my last purchase of Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	It came in good condition  Good
__label__Negative	We bought 4 100 e gift cards as a housewarming gift  Luckily they all went to the same person who was a relative  Two worked and two she couldnt pull up the card  She tried to fix the problem but couldnt and thank goodness told us about it so we could call Amazon and not lose 200  After many hours on the phone with Lowes and Amazon we finally got our 200 back which I just gave to our relative  If it hadnt been a relative the recipient may have never told us that the card didnt work and the money would have been wasted  Amazon was ultimately great in that they stood by their guaranty and gave us the money back but it was a huge hassle

__label__Positive	Simply Awesome I ordered one of these for my dad since he usually goes to Sears Auto to get his oil changes done I ordered it over the weekend and it arrived on time So much more convenient than going to the store and purchasing one The packaging was nice and simple It worked without any issues Will buy again in the future

__label__Positive	The birthday gift card I sent was received the same day  The recipient was on vacation and happy to see a bit more cash The gift card through Amazon has no additional expense If I had bought it in a store I would have had an additional fee plus the cost of sending it  Best of all Amazon has a wide range of products one can buy  The gift card allows the recipient to pick among a vast range of items so it is ideal for the person seems to have nearly everything  Unlike most other items Ill be buying more of these in the future

__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Like it
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	A perfect gift for anyone since its so versatile
__label__Positive	Loved it Great gift
__label__Positive	Lots of designs for different occasions at your printer tips  I have a friend who has the Amazon Kindle Fire and is an avid reader  Do you know someone who buys from Amazon a lot and doesnt have Amazon Prime Get them the 25 gift card and they wont have to pay shipping on what they buy

Think gift cards are impersonal  Not this one Choose from a list of designs and add your own personal greeting on the inside

Perfect gift for the person who has everything and youre at a loss figuring out what to buy for them
__label__Positive	This was a lastminute gift idea I didnt want to spend the set 25 for a storebought gift card  Amazon or otherwise So I came onto the website to order one I saw that you could set any amount and print it that same day
It was so awesome I did the same thing 2 weeks later
__label__Positive	I loved these gift cards They were given to our employees and were unique
__label__Positive	The person I gave this card to always shops at Amazon and bought a really nice gift for themself I would never have been able to get a gift this perfect
__label__Positive	always love an amazon gift card
__label__Negative	I purchased a 50 gift card for as a birthday gift  Ive never bought Amazons gift card before  I actually wanted a different card and gift box but Amazon doesnt have a 50 amount for it  So I decided to get this one instead  Not a good idea  The box was dirty smudged in various places as if someone with dirty fingers was doing all the shipping  Unfortunately I didnt look at the box before giving it  Id advice that you buy a card with a dark box that way any dirt wont show  Really disappointed with Amazon they could have taken a bit more pride  Especially since this is their product their gift card
__label__Positive	Fantastic Love Firehouse Subs
__label__Positive	Love to buy these who doesnt love to shop Amazon
__label__Negative	Its amazing how a very simple product can make so much troubles I live in Saskatchewan and I bought a birthday card for my brother who lives in Houston TX after wasting a whole day complaining and founding where the money goes I had to cancel the card and bought another from the US store There should be something like an international gift card
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Easy to buy and was delivered as promised
__label__Positive	Thankful for the ability to send easily from out of the USA to family inside the USA
__label__Positive	Everyone can find something they want at Amazon so gift cards make great gift ideas Love that I can now upload my own photo to make it more personal

__label__Positive	Beautiful card with the gift card she was happy
__label__Positive	Fast shipping and what a deal
__label__Positive	this make gifting so easy
__label__Positive	Came in a nice sturdy cardboard giftbox Its too bad the bottom part is plastic for a window  would of made an excellent box to store small stuff in
__label__Positive	Its a gift card what more can I say ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
__label__Negative	The purchase was a gift for someone else I understand that they enjoyed it very much but Im unable to attest to it personally
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Was super easy and turned out great A personal touch to an easy gift
__label__Positive	After reading about dented tins I thought Id give it a try At least the cards would useable Well they arrived in perfect condition in 1 day as advertised Outstanding

Thanks Amazon

__label__Positive	Most convienent Easy process to acquire Gift Card I never left my computer and best of all the recipient loved the gift

__label__Positive	I bought this for a Christmas gift  I love that I could print it immediately after purchase
__label__Positive	I sent the gift card to my sons family in Guam by email and they received it quickly and enjoyed shopping on Amazon for their gifts  This is a great way to send gifts to a family that you have no clue what to buy for them

__label__Positive	Genial
__label__Neutral	I can buy gift card with 20 off from Costco  This is a waste money purchase to the parents  Kids like it
__label__Positive	Perfect last minute gift for teenagers
__label__Neutral	This was purchased to go to be mailed to a customer with a hand written thank you note When we received the gift card the card it is mounted on was bent at the top and ripped at the bottom bandaged with a piece of clear tape Not very professional or desirable to send as a giftespecially to a valued customer

__label__Positive	I shop A LOT at Amazon so bought this for myself Its a good deal as you get this cute tin I love it but dont understand the concept of the window on the back as it even doesnt show the claim code However super fast shipping and I guess people would be happier to get the gift card in a nice tin than just an Email
__label__Positive	Perfect for gift giving

__label__Positive	A great gift and super fast delivery  I gave this to my wife who constantly reads on her Kindle

__label__Positive	they were great gifts
__label__Positive	Gift that keeps on giving A wide variety of uses for items I wouldnt normally get for myself
Also use as Mad Money
__label__Positive	What to say Its a gift card toward millions of things Made of plastic with numbers on it Works as descibed  put in the code it buys the stuff  you get it in a few days
__label__Negative	The card that I got was cheap and since it tells you to scratch off to see the numbers well its a sticker really Removing the sticker off caused it to rip off the 1st set of the code
__label__Positive	Thank you for your service Very grateful for this purchase
__label__Positive	The person this gift was given to was very very happy She has been going through alot it 2 years and we thought this was the perfect gift Thank you for offering this type of gift cards

__label__Negative	I was very pleased with it
__label__Positive	cute box same day shipping is very helpful
__label__Positive	Awesome It came just when it said it would and looked just like the picture too Also I liked that the card was not in the envelope so I could write a message So much better than just buying at the store especially because theres no extra fees
__label__Positive	Worked
__label__Positive	What can one write about a gift card  It was delivered on time as usual with amazon
__label__Positive	Same review as always because I find it do silly that they ask us to rate egift cards

3 That person usedspent it
4 Everyone was happy
5 The end
__label__Positive	Easy to use received the code fast
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	I gave these gift cards to my two sons who are very hard to buy for at this stage in their lives both in college  They loved getting them I wish someone had thought to buy one for mewho doesnt love Amazon
__label__Positive	Was a great gift and I will be using gift cards from now on Everyone was happy and got just what they wanted no return lines with the gift card Great Gift
__label__Positive	I feel like Amazon should limit what can have a product review I mean seriously its a gift card I guess if you received it and got a paper cut you may want to warn people that there is that potential hazard Or maybe you didnt get the correct design to which I say again its a gift card Youre not getting married to it Youll most likely toss it when youre done with it I guess there is the chance that the card is not active when you receive it but even still thats not the cards fault it is the card activator persons faultwe should be able to review them and their performancemy cards activation seemed to be a little slow even faulty at times Maybe the card activator person needs more training For the record my card worked no paper cut and the design was perfect
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	Gift receivers love getting Amazon Gift cards They are so very versatile and can be used for anything and everything on Amazon
__label__Positive	The card was readily available and easy to purchase

__label__Negative	This GameStop Gift Card was given as a Christmas gift  The recipient took the card to a local GameStop and was told the card had 0 on it  GameStop of course told him that it was a problem with amazon  Amazon customer service referred us back to GameStop for activation  A second trip to GameStop resulted in again an attempt to redeem a zero dollar gift card and being told there was nothing they could do  One more call to amazon customer service and the issue was handled very well and I ultimately received a refund for the gift card  I love ordering from amazon and I do feel their customer service is extremely helpful  However I will not be ordering gift cards through amazon in the future
__label__Positive	The item was the perfect gift for Christmas
__label__Positive	Easy and works great
__label__Positive	Cute video
__label__Positive	I am happy with this gifting facility to send gifts to loved ones in the USA

__label__Positive	I love the concept of 20 gift card I do have a lot of occasions where i have to gift an this offer helped me buy a gift for me too 
__label__Positive	Cute
__label__Positive	It arrived on time great for gift to someone who is a frequent shopper of amazoncom
__label__Positive	What is there not to love about an Amazon gift card  This is a no brainer in the gift department  It is something I love to give and receive  It comes nicely boxed and ready to go  Not much else I can say to be helpful except GREAT GIFT
__label__Positive	My grandson loved it since he has the choice of picking out what he wants  Would select it again so he could choose
__label__Positive	What can I say Ive been buying egift cards for years No shipping charges and the recipient always loves getting one

__label__Positive	Whats not to like
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	I love giving Amazon gift cards  They can be used for so many different products  A sure gift that will please
__label__Positive	Bought for my friends son who is in the 8th grade He loves the autonomy of being able to spend it on what he chooses as opposed to having a gift picked out by someone else This is a great gift for that stage of growth and development
__label__Positive	Clever and cute
__label__Positive	Easy way to give  gift that is always appreciated by an online shopper Will use this method more in the future
__label__Positive	GREAT
__label__Positive	Easy to purchase online at an amount you choose and charges to your amazon account Quick and easy activation with immediate availability
__label__Positive	Amazon gave me the ones with the full gray soles not the ones with gray on the tips  So this review will be on the ones with the full gray along the bottom and the rest white  Really like these  Im very picky with my clothes and I know better quality when I see it even if I see it on the internet  These are good quality for the price  They fit smooth and comfortable
__label__Positive	I liked that I can select the exact amount for the card  Could tie in with the age or other numberrelated issues for the recipient  Easy to print at home  After you buy you get an email that tells you how to print  The card doesnt fold exactly evening but who cares

__label__Positive	I am an avid reader and my husband bought me this gift card to buy books for my kindle I cant wait until Christmas when I can actually use it Since I know its there it feels like its burning a hole in the floor under the tree Best gift for bookworms like myself So if you know a reader but arent sure what they are into this is the card to buy This will definitely put a dent in my book wish list I wonder if I go ahead and activate it and start using it if anyone will knowhmmm
__label__Positive	I have used the gift card for multiple Kindle purchases I like the fact that Amazon tracks the balance so you dont have to
__label__Positive	My niece loved it
__label__Positive	I bought this for my brother for my familys secret santa last year It was perfect for him I had it sent to myself and simply took a photo of it for him to use the code Done
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt love an Amazon gift card I havent had any problems using any gift card from Amazon whether its for my Kindle use or regular purchases Ill take an Amazon gift card anytime
__label__Positive	Amazon is the best  You can find anything under the sun and at great pricesthe convenience of shopping and shipping all at once never leaving home

__label__Positive	Great wedding gift
__label__Positive	Cute
__label__Positive	Everyone loved these for Christmas Not just the money on the card but the box it came in Absolutely reusable
__label__Negative	I guess I should have known when I chose the Facebook option that it would show up in the recipients newsfeed along with the personalprivate message for all the world to see but I didnt I assumed it would go to their private message box So if you choose the FB option be forewarnedeverything you say will be seen be everyone
__label__Positive	I bought it during a lightning deal 50 gc for 40 to IHOP whats not to love
__label__Positive	One of the best places to eat and have fun Great gift card and free shipping

__label__Positive	Always such an easy way to get a scial cardThank You
__label__Positive	My grandson loved it He loves buying stuff on amazon so it worked out well
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Negative	I ordered a book and a gift card for my sister for her birthday I am a prime member so is my sister so it was a great gift Or so I thought I should have done the email one but I know my niece loves to use the old gift cards for her credit cards when pretend playing Book got there in two days no problem the gift card that I ordered at the same time never got there Ship Carrier  ONTRAC I wrote to amazon asking where it was after the 3 days They told me they could refund it 35 days or send a new one Still nothing turns out whatever company ONTRAC is decided they couldnt deliver it Sent it back to Amazon and now I cant send her a new one under Amazon policy about things being returned unshipped I still do not even have the refund My sister said someone else had the same trouble It seems ONTRAC wont deliver to apartment buildings So I am not sure why Amazon is using them if they dont go everywhere Just really sad and disappointing I ended up getting her an iTunes giftcard via Facebook
__label__Positive	I found this gift certificate so convenient when at the last minute I didnt have a birthday gift  It was sent to their email and I didnt even have to get out etc  Will do again when needed
__label__Positive	Good choice of designs though would like Amazon to add an elegant design as well as cute pretty colourful etc and the card always arrives by email in good time on selected day Also its so convenient to be able to buy it in dollars from amazoncom for American neice or to print it out for relations and friends here in the UK to include with their Christmasbirthday cards for example Love receiving these gift cards myself All in all a great service  particularly when a lastminute gift is required Often wonder how I managed without it in preAmazon days
__label__Positive	Yes it met my expectations
__label__Positive	No comment
__label__Positive	Had to cancel regular shipping get prime reorder for same day shipping because the gift card was just sitting for a few days and was not shipping Dragging your feet over sending a gift card is ridiculous Regardless at the end of the day its a gift card so 4 stars it is
__label__Positive	perfect gift for the teens tweens and young adult  great for anyone  who cant find an item on amazon that they would want
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong
__label__Positive	Cute
__label__Positive	My daughter loved the star and the cash
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt want an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	It was a gift card afterall is said and done it was easy to use
and easy to use for what I wanted
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Received my gift card promptly with zero issues  I love Applebees and used it right away
__label__Positive	Excellent product The perfect way for Venezuelans yo name purchases of products above 400  dont know what elae to say about this product
__label__Positive	Amazon is a great place to shop everything one could want is at your fingertips  I do advise not using your bank card only a credit card  My account was violated hours after I used my debit card to pay for items purchased on your site

I still want to thank give this purchase a good rating the site is great folks in Customer Service are wonderful and very easy gift giving or just a Thank you to someone for a kind act

Toughen up on your security Please

__label__Positive	I sent this to my Brothers family in Virginia and they loved it especially the message I sent inside lol
__label__Positive	Ive given Amazon gift cards to several people in the past  This year  for Christmas  was not different  This is an excellent way to let someone pick out their choice  If this is your first time  and youre not sure if the recipient has Amazon Prime  or they do not have a Kindle  be sure to consider a gift card of 30 or more in order to cover free shipping  Great gift idea for anyone
__label__Positive	I love Peets Starbucks and Philz  Whenever I can get a discounted gift card thats a plus in my book  Not much else to say  I usually get my Peets card at Costco but that comes in a 4pack  I was able to get a single pack here

__label__Positive	With this ecard will be happy next people adjacency
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Positive	Its always nice to send a gift that is worth what it costs  Most bank giftcards cost more than the face amount but Amazon doesnt
__label__Negative	This will likely be my last review  ever plan to really go out of my way to avoid buying anything from Amazon in the future I Ordered this product on the basis of a guaranteed next day delivery for a friends birthday  I took a screenshot of of webpage showing the guarantee screen The next day checking status Amazons website tracking indicates a delay of 2 extra days  3 day delivery instead of next day I called up Amazon expecting some kind of help on expediting the shipment or at least giving me the option to switch it over to an electronic gift certificate  Instead I spent an hour with different call center folks in India trying to smooth talk me into accepting that there is no option but to wait for deliver that they could not cancel and reissue the order Basically they provides a series of hollow apologies but didnt lift a finger What a load of BS I told them that if I cancelled the order and placed a new one  my gift would get there faster than the best that amazon support could do for me At this point they said they coudnt cancel the order either I asked to speak to a supervisor and heres where I was extremely disappointed to hear exactly the same thing When I asked them what the definition of the guarantee was I got absolute silence Not only that but the supervisor seemed to be annoyed at the question itself They would not lift a finger to help me and didnt offer anything After pressing the supervisor on the fact that I placed my order with Amazon on the basis of  guarantee and an expectation that a birthday present would arrive on birthday she finally said the best she could do was give me one month free on my prime subscription I realized these people were only going to delay me further  I declined and informed the supervisor that I wanted to cancel the order immediately She at least helped me with this cancellation  Immediately afterwards I  ordered an apple store egift certificate in  a few seconds problem solved Friend happy True it was not in the pretty package I had planned for but at least it made it on time From my perspective Amazon had previously been a great vendor the A to Z guarantee was honored by them in several occasions great support But obviously things there are going downhill So long Amazon

__label__Positive	This gift was well received and appreciated I will use these Amazon cards again
__label__Positive	I like how easy it is to gift items to readers on Amazon For those times when I want to just give a gift certificate via email its great The only thing that would make it even better is if Amazon tied into Facebook or Google so all Id need to know would be a Facebook or Google name to award the gift card to
__label__Positive	My friend shops alot on Amazon and this was the perfect gift for her She already knew what she was going to spend it on
__label__Positive	Its a Gift Card

__label__Positive	She loves strange animals and this gift card fit the bill
__label__Positive	My friend was in the hospital and not feeling well at all but didnt want flowers  So the Amazon gift card I sent him really hit the spot He had his IPad with him and a WiFi connection so he bought a number of books which cheered him up a lot
__label__Positive	Good Gift Almost everyone will like Because of receiving a case with no DVD in it you might want to check a DVD is there if you purchase one

If you see it after 30 days you are out of luck
__label__Positive	I give five stars to the product because is very practical and convinient
The best part is that the gift card has no expiration
__label__Positive	Came in very handy when u dont know what to get for a 17 year old
__label__Positive	Daughter wanted a Kindle so family all gave her gift cards towards her purchase she got the Kindle a week later and is quite pleased The gift card was very easy to purchase and it allows the recipient to choose their own gift so no disappointment no returns

__label__Positive	Quality packaging
__label__Positive	Bought this gift card for a family member They loved it
__label__Negative	I knew this was going to be crap when I bought it but it was for a joke so I figured I would give it a shot Do not buy this The only way we got it open the maze is a joke even completing it does not open the thing was giving it to my 2 year old and he threw it on the floor which popped it open

__label__Positive	Easy to use
__label__Positive	I sent this gift card to my sister when she delivered a baby girl  very happy about this desgn  I expect more designs of gift cards from Amazon
__label__Neutral	I ordered the card as a birthday resent for a friend Everythign seem to go smoothly until I got an email form Amazon stating the card was defective and that they were going to send me a replacement card next day shipping no charge pretty awesome from them Sadly the second card was defective too and even though I got a refund it kinda ruined the present for my friend
__label__Positive	I purchased the gift card for my niece who lives in another state The gift card arrived exactly as scheduled The only issue I have is that there was nothing on the package that indicated the name of the sender so my niece didnt know who sent her the gift card Other than that everything else about Amazons gift card program are great

__label__Positive	Printable gift cards at home make the perfect gift  I often decide to give a gift card at the last minute and it saves me going to a store to purchase it
__label__Positive	I waited till the last minute to buy a birthday gift for a very dear friend  I knew another friend had purchased a Kindle Fire for her birthday and wanted her to be able to buy something right away  The print option is great I have a laser color printer so it came out very colorful and she loved it  Im the type that procrastinates when it comes to shopping at brick and mortor shops so the option to get this item online is perfect for me
__label__Positive	Its a gift card  It fulfills all my hopes and dreams I had for a gift card  If you are looking for an Amazon gift card this is it  It works as advertised
__label__Positive	Worked great no issues the receiver liked it a lot and has used it since we sent it to him for his birthday

__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	Always works for me when I use it
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	The video is really fun and the recipient loved the whole thing  Not sure I will choose Facebook next time as the avenue  The recipient almost missed it entirely by uncharacteristically going a few days without checking Facebook  I had to call her up and tell her again to go in and claim it  Once she did she loved it
__label__Positive	Love gift cards They make it so easy to be sure the recipient is able to purchase what they want
__label__Positive	If you ever draw a blank on a gift this is always the perfect solution
__label__Negative	I purchased two 50 gift cards and four 25 gift cards they all arrived in the same package all of the tins were vacuumed sealed in plastic with no amount on the tin identifying which card they were i had to unwrap the cards and check the claim code for each card on the amazon website to determine the amount of each card this process is ridiculous
__label__Positive	cute card and fast delivery
__label__Positive	Excellent job
__label__Positive	my brother loved it

__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Negative	It came as a piece of paper with a code when I typed in the code to the website it said to go to it had to be numbers only and there were letters in the code amazon gave me
__label__Positive	Being able to gift a friend or client with an Email Amazon gift card has made my life easier Theres no need to go to the store and then to the post office where Id pay more money to get the card to them Thank you Amazon for making my life just a little more simply

__label__Positive	gift card  gift card no complaint
__label__Positive	Such a great box
__label__Positive	thanks
__label__Positive	Good idea for far away family
__label__Positive	OK  thought it would be a eprint  certificate
__label__Negative	This was supposed to to be an ecard I bought it ONLY because it was supposed to be an ecard If the description were accurate and notified me that it had to be printed I would never have bought it because I dislike Safeway generally Waste of my time and money
__label__Positive	Gift was well received
__label__Positive	A quick delivery
__label__Positive	Went great
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Easy to purchase and downloada quick gift

__label__Positive	It was perfect
__label__Positive	Great gift to give anybody who doesnt love Italian food
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Just the easiest way to meet the gift card needs
__label__Neutral	Es una excelente opcin para ir haciendo un fondo y ahorrar para realizar una compra a tu gusto en el caso de Venezuela que tenemos un cupo limitado juntamos los poquitos que nos va quedando en las tarjetas de credito hasta conseguir los fondos necesarios
__label__Negative	Did  not arrive on time and disappeared  before readingi had to forward my email order to recipient
__label__Positive	I suggest that it be offered with lesser amounts also
If we are going to celebrate Christmas we should remember why it started

__label__Positive	It was a very welcome gift  It looked finished inthe little black box A nice touch
__label__Positive	Just right for the event

__label__Positive	Delivered in minutes
__label__Positive	Great way to get gift cards
__label__Positive	Such an easy way to send a gift
__label__Positive	Awesome deal with quick delivery
__label__Positive	I love that these gift cards are so easy to give and worth it if your going to end up shipping a gift to the person anyways or gift card
__label__Positive	The recipient always loves this
__label__Positive	excellent
__label__Positive	Gift card comes in a good quality Christmas card  I happen to love animals and Im glad there was an adorable choice of a cat and dog bought gift cards in both animals  The recipients remarked how cute the dog and cat were on each Christmas card
__label__Positive	As I am generally unimaginative live in the middle of no where  and hate people and crowded malls I find gifting an Amazon gift card a stroke of genius Pretty much anything anyone could want can be found on Amazon and I dont have to put any real thought into what they might like Its a win win
__label__Positive	First time I bought a Gif Card and from now on will be my new method of shopping amazon I am very pleased  Thank you
__label__Neutral	I didnt have enough choices for the type of card I wanted to use but it sufficed
__label__Positive	Great way to give a gift especially when your not sure what the recipient likes
__label__Positive	EASY TO SHOP GOOD TO USE
__label__Positive	I was surprised to find printable amazon gift cards I was late getting to the store and thought I would order one online and give it to my friend a little late I found the printable ones and she had her gift card that night So fun Would like to see more styles but it works
__label__Positive	Christmas gift for my daughter  husband and they were delighted
__label__Positive	My grandson loved it
__label__Positive	Cool tins without any extra charge over the gift amount
__label__Positive	I ordered this specific one because I liked the gift box I look at it as a bonus because it comes WITH the card at no additional charge I am giving 4 stars however because the bow was not on the box and was obvious that it fell off left behind was a hot glue spot not very appealing
__label__Positive	I mistakenly sent eGift card to a nonworking address an address once used by recipient but no longer  I contacted Amazon and the Rep was more than happy to help me correct the problem  The card finally made it to the right address and the recipient was happy
__label__Positive	Great buy
__label__Positive	Ive sent several of these cards over the past year  They were very well received by friends all of them having broken limbs and were housebound for a few weeks  The cards were put to good use by the recipients  All of them had a good time picking out which books  DVDs they wanted to purchase to help them pass the time
__label__Positive	Made the gift card so much more special
__label__Positive	took my friend and my mom out to eat with this awesome and easy to purchase they throw peanuts on the floor in this restaurant which was hella funny but it was most def good food thanks
__label__Positive	I am very pleased with the gift card
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	Would have been nice to be able to personalize
__label__Positive	The best gift for people who have definite tastes and desires No point in trying to second guess what they would want  let the recipient decide what to get And the cards can be emailed instant arrival in time for a party or mailed arriving in a few days
__label__Positive	Recommend getting childrengrandchildren gift cards in this day and time of High Tech toys  Easy to please with a gift card and no wracking the brain
__label__Positive	good
__label__Neutral	The greeting cards do not fit into the envelopes provided which is silly  Still Amazon did quickly supply 3 ten dollar gift cards each in a decent holiday greeting card
__label__Positive	quick email delivery no problems
__label__Positive	My husband and I enjoy eating out once a week  Chilis is my favorite local chain restaurant I also collect meal points for every food item I order  I like their Mexican dishes and the restaurant is quiet despite a loud bar because the bar is away from the dining area and enclosed in its own glass walls  I also buy gift cards for family members across the country when I know theres one in the area

We only have Chilis in Sierra Vista but there are Macaroni Grills and On the Borders across Texas and on my drive to Chicagoland every Christmas  I have never had any issues using these cards  These cards cover the entire bill including alcoholic drinks  There is no expiration date so when gift cards hit the Lightning Deals I try to get one  You save 10 when you are able to snag a deal off Amazon
__label__Negative	My wife and I thought it would be a good idea to add several of these gift cards to our wedding registry  Terrible idea Make sure you read the fine print before adding them to your registry or purchasing one for someone else  You can only use one gift card per booking  You can combine two gift cards via their website  Honestly which major company do you know of that restricts your use of gift certificates None
__label__Positive	Nice easy last minute gift We got this for my boss on bosses day he had recently gone on a diet so that nixed the usual Starbucks gift card Also nice to not even have to leave the office to get it
__label__Positive	I have the gift card credit set up on my Amazon account and intend to use it shortly  I have done this in the past and it has worked very well
__label__Positive	God card
__label__Positive	This was a birthday gift for granddaughter The cupcake case was darling and perfect for a ten year old
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	I bought this during a lightning deal and got the 50 gift card for 40 You cant beat that free 10 basically Great gift to give to anyone with pets
__label__Positive	Its a gift card Love that we can send it through Text to recipient
__label__Positive	We have been purchasing Menchies gift cards from the local store for kids birthday parties for the last year or so since my son got one at his 5th birthday party Believe it or not sometimes stopping by a frozen yogurt shop with 2 kids in tow is not the most productive thing to do and I am usually getting the gifts pretty last minute

I went online and purchased this after arriving at the birthday party and had it shipped directly to the birthday boys house They received it within a couple of days and it was a great extension of the birthday party I am going to purchase several more and have them shipped to me so that I always have a stash of emergency birthday party gifts
__label__Positive	Found this an easy and convenient way to give a gift to my granddaughter and found she made good use of it
__label__Positive	allguersts likedit
__label__Positive	Great value for a great restaurant
__label__Negative	I paid 150 dollars why did it only say 100  You charged me 150
__label__Positive	Fast and easy my friend received this in a matter of minutes with no issues Definitely one of the easiest and safest ways to give a gift
__label__Negative	Nowhere I found to write a message
__label__Positive	Just perfect for a first gift certificate for grandson with advantage of safe and easy to supervise spending
__label__Positive	Works fast and its effective
__label__Positive	Easy to do  Colorful  Recipient loved it  Really enjoyed giving a gift that was really appreciated  Saved shopping in a store

__label__Positive	always a great gift
__label__Positive	Awesome and easy gift for any kindle lover Printed fast and it was usable right off the bat I will definitely use this again
__label__Positive	Love it great food
__label__Negative	This card shows a 25 balance but so far has been unreadable by 4 different Peets locations I am currently working on getting it replace but am having difficulty doing so
Peets has explained that if the card were purchased from them directly there would be no issues with an exchange but since it is from a third party seller they cannot honor an exchange
__label__Positive	Made my stomach hurt but nice place
__label__Positive	Super easy and my cousin can get anything he needs
__label__Positive	A friend ordered this for us cause were homeless much needed
__label__Positive	Great product
__label__Positive	excelente
__label__Positive	Gift very convenient

__label__Positive	I cant think of anything more useful than an Amazon gift card  and this tin is so pretty I just hope that the person I got it for can get things with Prime since I have it Made the mistake of not asking ahead of time Will call to see
__label__Positive	Free teddy why not
__label__Positive	Perfect gift and I love the choices on Amazon
__label__Positive	easy to buy and customize for the one youre gifting to Super quick delivery time too
__label__Positive	The amount of the gift card was not shown The recipient upon opening it had no idea its value The one I ordered at Christmas showed the amount on the face of the card
__label__Positive	My grandkids who are teenagers love Nanas holiday presents Theres nothing like a gift card when youre older than thirteen We make a habit of it around here
__label__Positive	Good gift for when you dont know what the recipient likes

__label__Positive	Delivered and worked as promised
__label__Positive	This was a great easy gift
__label__Positive	Cute Box Loved giving the gift card in this cute box The only negative I can say about it is that it has a rectangular cutout in the bottom so they can program the amount onto the card I wish that cutout had a clear plastic piece in it so they could use this box to store things in after they use the gift card
__label__Positive	GREAT ITEM FOR THE IHOP LOVER
__label__Negative	I may have to rethink using amazon gift cards The last one I sent I actually had to contact the recipient myself to see if it had been delivered Rather embarassing What happened to emailing when it is picked up by the recipient If you cannot do that I wont be buying any more

__label__Positive	Love the holiday tins and the awesome card inside

__label__Positive	Its a gift card I redeemed it and it worked 5 stars
__label__Positive	My daughter and I used to send each other Hoops and Yoyo ecards they were free back then so this was the perfect theme to send with a surprise gift card Much more effective than a photo gift card The animated card adds so much Priceless characters 
__label__Positive	Very Good no complains at all
__label__Neutral	I ordered this for my husband for our wedding anniversary I should have placed the order a day earlier because we live in Australia Consequently he received it a day late Perhaps Amazon could issue a alert on the website or allow the gift cards to be sold from their Australian website

__label__Positive	Love them but wish they had the amounts printed on them

__label__Positive	Good for a gift for anyone
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with a Gift Certificate for a 14year old grandaughter who hasnt developed the full sense of what she wants yet    Thanks Amazon  
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Truly lightens
__label__Positive	The gift card was very well received by my daughter  It was a fun design and easy to purchase for her
__label__Positive	My son was very pleased with the gift card as he buys books etc all the time from Amazon  He also said that the frog card was funny just our style of Parents to son conversation  It is hard to purchase anything to give to a grown son but a gift card to purchase from Amazon is always the correct thing

Sincerely
alice g
__label__Positive	It arrived immediately  My niece lives in New York and Im in Des Moines  Sending something always takes a long time and Im a procrastinator  Plus she doesnt have much room in her NY apartment so trying to buy something isnt always such a great idea  No where to put it  The gift card was perfect  email was perfect  She recd quickly and can purchase ANYTHING she wants or needs  Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Love these
__label__Positive	Absolute godsend enables me to gift safely to family in the USA and they have much more choice from Amazon than any supermarketstore when redeeming
__label__Negative	Takes hours to get approval Make sure you dont need these gift cards right away or even in a day
__label__Positive	Christmas gift
__label__Positive	Excellent buy
__label__Negative	This is a review of the apparent lifetime limit of four Papa Johns Gift Cards Cant order more than four ever apparently I order 4 a week ago and now whenever I go to reorder them this seller does not allow it They just get knocked out of my cart when I go to checkout Used to order them 20 at a time but now theres some limit So you dont want my money WTF
__label__Positive	Wonderfully funny
__label__Positive	The animation was very fun and pretty I sent it to my best friend for her birthday and she loved it
__label__Positive	This product was exactly what I was looking for I wish the Amazon logo was present on the front of the gift card itself The logo was printed on the back of the both cards and the recipient wasnt quite sure what it was at first
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	A real hit much better than email Loved it
__label__Positive	Great idea love it
__label__Positive	great gift idea
__label__Neutral	Because I think the description of the product was wrong I am not sure either of the people I bought these gift cards for have an Amazon account
__label__Positive	I gave this to my son and daughter in law for their 2nd anniversary  They loved it
__label__Positive	Like
__label__Positive	A nice variety of colorful gift card holders which will definitely serve the purpose The little velcro dot connectors have a tendency to pull loose and come off which is my only concern An otherwise great product
__label__Positive	Easy to order and nice choices made for a great gift  Much easier than having to look for a gift that may not be what someone wanted
__label__Positive	given as a gift person liked it
__label__Neutral	did not appreciate having to enter my credit card number twice just to print the card
__label__Positive	Arrived within 24 hours  It came with Holiday cardready for gift giving  Totally awesome  Ill do it again next year  
__label__Negative	I SEND TO AS A GIFT TO MY GRANDSON AND THEY ARE AT THE GAP AND THE CARD HAVE O LEFT ON IT I SPENT 2500 ON THIS CARD AND CAN ONT USE IT THEY BETTER SEND ME ANOTHER CARD DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE
__label__Positive	useful
__label__Positive	I had this sent to my sister in law who lives in Alaska I ordered it on May 2nd and it was delivered on the 6th She loves shopping amazon for appsso this was a perfect gift
__label__Positive	I liked the color scheme and the theme Thank you I also liked the script style Add a tiny bit of a historical middle eastern city on the left hand side and and see if it makes it even more interesting
__label__Positive	Great way to gift You get the card envelop and gift card in one easy stop I would recommend this product
__label__Positive	cool
__label__Positive	It was the perfect gift to send long distance
__label__Positive	Duh its an Amazon card how could you go wrong with this as a gift
__label__Positive	Received quickly
__label__Positive	This was a perfect last minute fathers day gift for my dad It was getting down to the wire and I wasnt sure what to get him This gift card came with its own fathers day card one less purchase I had to make and arrived in just 2 days Perfect
__label__Neutral	Cute idea but construction could use some work Or maybe just include some helpful tips on how to fold into standing position without tearing
__label__Positive	Was a gift He loved it
__label__Positive	Great seller
__label__Positive	I found this a great birthday idea for my vest friend who just got a kindle and who is going overseas on holiday she now has a reading supply instead of having to take books
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with Amazon gift cards  Whatever they want they can get on Amazoneven food LOL
Youll never have to fear missing a birthday or being late again  They will email your gift right over
__label__Positive	The gift card came in an attractive holiday folder with an envelope The recipient was very pleased as was I
__label__Positive	Very easy to use Fast and convenient way to get a gift card
__label__Positive	What can you say Amazon pretty much has something for everyone so you cant go wrong with these  Also if your like me and need a gift 5 minutes before you leave for the party these cards are perfect
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	Purchasing Gift card was easy and immediate  I was able to select the image on the card and found an appropriate one select the amount and send
__label__Positive	Hassle free way to go to the movies with good friends
__label__Positive	I did NOT buy a gift card for 100  Someone needs to look into this  I also did not buy the last one in the amount of 5000 Virginia Bond
__label__Positive	Nor much to judge on a gift card
__label__Positive	AWESOME gift card that comes with a complimentary greeting card with the design of your choice Can it get any better than this Highly recommend to give as a gift
__label__Positive	Fast delivery through email
__label__Positive	A cute substitute for a birthday card
__label__Positive	Easy gift
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	good for the price you Pay i liked the cover
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	Excellent and easy way to send a gift  I send a few of these a year and the recipients love them
__label__Positive	Purchased some great slippers for my stepfather for Christmas with the gift card He was thrilled The card arrived quickly enough for me to place the order and still have them arrive for Christmas
I did 80 of my shopping through amazon this year with great success If I couldnt find an item on amazon I found a gift card for a store I could find it at and still was able to shop online
__label__Positive	I purchased this today and received the code within 2 minutes I used the code and pin to check out at Sephora online and it worked with no problems One thing that I noticed is that it doesnt work to copy and paste the card number from the email that Amazon sends because it has spaces between the groups of numbers On the Sephora website there cant be spaces between the numbers when you enter the card number in at check out Just a heads up

The card totally worked and I will be purchasing more cards going forward
__label__Positive	So easy to use just put them in and im ready to buy  I would recommend this to anyone who is not sure what to buy or wants to contribute to a particular gift without giving cash
__label__Positive	Excellent and timely manner
__label__Positive	Always a perfect gift
__label__Positive	Love it thank you
__label__Positive	Perfect for any gift
__label__Positive	Great way to send gifts
__label__Positive	Its a gift card Why does amazon demand we write a review and cant just put stars
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	So easy to order and give  The container was great for Christmas and our Niece and Nephew lovedit
__label__Positive	This was perfect for the person you just dont know what they need
__label__Positive	Dollar for dollar value so no issues here Great as a gift
__label__Positive	Received as expected
__label__Positive	Always an easy way to send a gift that can anything the recipient wants

__label__Negative	Bought this EMAIL gift card for my daughter She filled her cart went to the cashier who did not know anything about the GC went to customer service manager who also acted like they had never heard of it But the manager did tell her the card must be PRINTED out to be used No where does it say this Dear Safeway It is 2018 The world is going paperless  Your staff should know how to handle these cards If it must be printed SAY SO when ordering so I can go to another store Also I am sure there is a printer in your store Why did they not offer to print it for her You made her feel less than by turning her away and I cannot forgive you for this  Never again Bad bad form Safeway

This emailed gift card is a lifesaver Two minutes and its on its way Whoosh Plus you can add a personal message and even your own picture So for my dad I added a picture of the two of us and it made it look like I put way more thought into it than I did

Plus as an added bonus my entire family are bookworms If for any reason they cant find anything worth buying hard to believe since amazon has everything they can always buy books Love it

Ive bought this a few times now and never had any problems with them receiving it or using it
__label__Positive	Delivered next day No extra charge for the card
__label__Positive	Extremely cute nice size Can hold a small gift and some treats Too bad Amazon sent it in a bubble envelope with no other protection so it is dented
__label__Positive	Good product liked it a lot and it works very well with what I put it on Thanks For a good product
__label__Positive	This was a great anniversary gift for my hubby He loves to shop on Amazon
__label__Positive	Love it

__label__Positive	My sisters favorit place to go for Lunch
__label__Positive	Came on time Cant go wrong with a gift card
__label__Negative	code did not work tride varies stores very disapointed

__label__Positive	We bought gift cards for our tween nephews Christmas made easy
__label__Positive	This makes a great wedding gift easy to purchase arrived in a swift manner and provides the wedding couple a gift they wanted
__label__Negative	I dont know what this is about  I never received such a card  May I have some more details please

__label__Positive	Convenient and recipient loved it They will buy books for their kindle
__label__Positive	So easy to print gift cards or send them electronically Very convenient
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly My dad was happy for the gift 
__label__Negative	Bought this 25 gift card for 20 on July 14 2016 didnt use it until today September 7  Was excited to use the card until my happiness was crushed when the lady at the register said there is no money on this card I then thought maybe she didnt know what she was doing  Then I attempted to use it online which also stated no money available  Wow I was fooled out of 20 bucks
pissed off customer
__label__Positive	I will probably use this service again  It was quick didnt have to leave my home and it gave my friend an opportunity to buy something she would want
__label__Positive	Purchase went smoothly delivery did as well
__label__Positive	very cool A very customizable gift on the fly As long as you have a color printer youll be fine
__label__Positive	While Im out of the country purchasing an Amazon E gift card had two benefits  It was an easy way to surprise my mother for Christmas And since my mother has novice computer skills it will be a great way for her to acquire some shopping on line experience with a nonthreating and safe website 
__label__Positive	I like getting the lightning deals for gift cards on Amazon  Getting a 50 card for 40 is always cool especially if I normally use it or shop there anyway  I bought this to use when we go to the movies and getting 10 free more than compensates for the extra 2 dollar charge for each ticket  I like getting my ticket before going to the theater since it avoids the line of getting a ticket and since so many theaters now have reserved seating it is almost becoming mandatory  If you are running late having your ticket already is a life saver  The eticket is nice because I often place gift cards in drawers or weird places and have to go find them  I can access this ticket on my phone or a computer  How convenient
__label__Positive	So easy to do
__label__Positive	Sister and BrotherinLaw Christmas Gift  They loved it  Ease of buying on Amazon
__label__Positive	Was a gift for my bro Its great that he can go to all 3 placeshe shops at all 3 although not often but now he will lol

__label__Positive	Amazon EGIFT cards are the perfect gift No shipping charges and you get an email confirmation when it is redeemed Win win
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	This was the perfect gift for someone who loves Amazon
__label__Positive	Unfortunately the code on the card didnt print out entirely but I figured it out
__label__Positive	Great gift idea or just use them yourself Ive bought and used a bunch of these and have never had any issues with scanning or unexpected dollar amounts like some reviews have claimed
__label__Positive	Comes through the mail as a physical gift card It is what it is 50 worth of COFFEE
__label__Positive	Healthy choices  great service and the food is fresh and delicious
__label__Positive	They make great gifts
__label__Positive	gift for Christmas
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a thank you and a coffee
__label__Positive	I love buying these for friends at a distance because its so simple I can have it emailed and they can pick out anything they like works great 
__label__Positive	Having a means to get a gift to a loved one in a timely manner gives them an opportunity to select what they would like to have 
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love a gift card from Amazon So many things to choose from This card was the most requested for christmas gifts from my family
__label__Positive	Sunglasses for my daughters birthday how about a gift card
__label__Positive	Gift cards are the best
__label__Positive	niece liked it spotted it at grocery store checkout later probably easier
__label__Negative	Amazon screwed up last year when the removed the functionality allowing me to send my grandkids and others an Amazon gift card to their facebook page  I was never able to obtain an answer as to why that was taken away  All that is left for placement on FB is a group card with less flexibility on the amount of the card
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Negative	couldnt apply it to a kindle when we were told it would instead we have now lost about 5000 in gift cards
__label__Positive	I ordered on day and received it the next  A gift card allowed the recipient to combine with other gift cards to purchase larger items
__label__Positive	My niece in Chicago was very happy to receive this gift card for her 13th birthday
__label__Positive	Kindle Paperwhite was a big hit for the reader who likes to read when the cosleeper is ready for lights out Easy to use  lightweight
__label__Positive	Good for most Starbucks but bought this for a vacation and the hotel advertised a Starbucks on site but the store on site wouldnt accept any cards So has to spend some of my cash planned for other things  Beware of Starbucks at vacation hotels they may have a Starbucks name but dont HAVE to accept the Starbucks gift cards
__label__Positive	I found out about print at home Gift cards by Amazon this Diwali and I printed like 30 of them I loved giving these over the holidays and it was the best gift without any dispute The best thing was convenience Thanks for making it possible
__label__Negative	It was a hassle getting the 10 bonus gift card for the christmas promo offer  Had to call customer service and waste my time before it was applied
__label__Positive	who doesnt like a gift card
__label__Positive	The holder was adorable and at the time of this writing Amazon ships gift cards next day  Wonderful

The tin itself is sturdy enough that you can get a few uses out of it if you reuse them as I do

Perfect gift  will definitely use this again next year
__label__Positive	I got a 2500 Amazon gift card but had a craving for pizza instead I was really glad when I saw I could get another gift card with my old gift card Its just what it says it is there no purchasing fee like some gift cards on here have I like that I could get it through email and didnt have to wait for it to come in the mail
__label__Positive	Beautiful gift box Arrived on time

__label__Positive	great idea to send a gift card from far awaylove the image upload option to make it personal
__label__Positive	Cards are fine packaging is a pain Couldnt get the plastic to cut with scissors imagine having to stab 65 of these things with a pen while at work to give out at a work party later
__label__Positive	got this for a friend and they liked it
__label__Positive	As a teenage girl who loves clothes I ordered this on a Monday it shipped on Tuesday and arrived early Wednesday morning I am beyond happy with this purchase I recommend buying this if you need a gift card for yourself or for someone else in a short amount of time
__label__Positive	Easy to complete the order and it was quite simple to use for the receiver
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are the perfect gift The recipient can shop for the things they like and want  It is a perfect way to say thank you to a family member or friend that have helped you in some way

I brought this for a friend in the US but normally i am unable to buy them online from overseas US zip code so very happy that Amazon sell them

Thank you

__label__Positive	As promised
__label__Positive	Amazon has anything and everything I live a couple of hours away from my family and I send these gift cards with a couple of clicks and its their in no time on their smart phones They shop at home with no fuss or going anywhere and get what they want Great idea
__label__Positive	You can always find something on Amazon you need
__label__Positive	I have a problem with remembering birthdays until the last minute These have been a lifesaver With free 1 day shipping and an included message it seems like I put more thought into it than I did I love these cards Now if you could just make more designs that would be awesome
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	exellent service never any problems
__label__Positive	Worked great for a lastminute gift
__label__Positive	Glad to see you are expanding gift cards selection
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	I LOVE receiving gift cards for my birthday I always have a wish list that I can shop from and its so much fun to see a giftcard in my birthday card
__label__Positive	Christmas Gift for the wifeand always a hit Im sure shes already gone through it
__label__Positive	An easy convenient and appreciated gift
__label__Positive	Its a gift card came quickly
__label__Positive	Very cute box Amazons shipping is always super fast  The card is like other cards  worked as good as the money on it  But the best is the box in which it comes
__label__Neutral	The enclosed gift card is actually cash register paper I wanted this gift card to be from my wife and I but the card highlights my name since it was issued from my account instead of the gift message that you enter which is nearly microscopic The actual card and box however is exceptionally well done and I guess that is important to Amazon I would just like them to consider what is important to the giver
__label__Positive	Yay
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Positive	Grandsons were delighted Will use them for date nights or friends night out
__label__Positive	Works exactly as a gift card should
__label__Negative	Product lacks quality Did not transmit When recipient tried to open it said incorrect code  even though it was printed in the invoice Extremely unreliable product and ruins what should be a good experience A straight Fail
__label__Negative	Although the gift card did eventually arrive because currency conversion was needed  the process of sending it was unclear and frustrating I even finished up with a print your own file on my computer which wouldnt print so I couldnt even post it to my grandaughter

Please make the website procedures more straight forward
__label__Positive	Great gift card to go with an Amazon gift card I sent to my brother  We love Hoops and Yoyo
__label__Positive	Great way to send Birthday present
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	It was upbeat fun witty and got your attention
The gift card with a bonus was good incentive for me
to try that feature An instant gift for todays savvy
kid shoppers can only be well received
__label__Positive	It was so easy to send to a coworker who was out ill from work lots of design options available
__label__Positive	made a pretty way to give a gift certificate will do the same this year
__label__Positive	This was the perfect gift for my mom She was able to use it on anything she wanted from books to cell phone cases and touts for her dog
__label__Positive	Yes it did thank you
__label__Positive	I love the service of how they delivered it I ordered it one evening and next day around 9AM the cards werein front of my door great gift
__label__Positive	I loved this card and it is so convenient  Other people should take advantage of this and get their gift cards through  Amazon
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Great Idea for everyone who is on Facebook easy way to give a gift and then they can spend on Amazon
__label__Positive	Perfect gift Allowed option for my recipient to choose which restaurant to use at We live in a very rural area and our Red Lobster accepted this gift card 
__label__Negative	I dropped 37500 for 4 Amazon gift cards and 4 different gift card tins to keep track  1400 spent on 4 tinsgot 4 blue folded cheap cardboard envelopes all the same  Weak  And yes I saw your weak disclaimer  Nothing screams Christmas like giving people BLUE cardboard envelopes ALL the same  Weak cheap and awful
__label__Positive	My daughter loved it
__label__Positive	WWhat a beautiful thing to be able to purchase an Amazon Gift Card on the website be able to personalize it free shipping and a lovely tin to give it in Love this
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	You can NEVER go wrong with an Amazon gift card I love giving gifts and receiving gift cards from Amazon
__label__Positive	Easy to use and so many items from which to choose We could agree on so many of the choices
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are great and the card they come in is nice too
__label__Positive	Can save money on buying a card and use your own wording Would spend an extra 1 for a better quality card But overall the gift is complete with a card included
__label__Positive	How much easier can you get Physical card or electronic mailed to recipient or to me free oneday shipping Cant get much better than this
__label__Positive	Every one loves gift cards
__label__Positive	Excellent Gift for Anyone I gave it to my soninlaw and he was Very Happy
__label__Positive	Perfect as always
__label__Positive	My mom loved it
__label__Positive	Recipient enjoyed the gift
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	We sent this as a gift to my motheronlaw who is an avid kindle reader  She thought it was cute and caloriefree  She is saving the tin for my daughter
__label__Positive	Whats not to like
__label__Positive	The design  the color is very appropriate for graduation gift
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	I like that Amazon made their gift cards easy and practical  You can print out your own personalized card with the gift card code printed inside  It saves time and money since you dont have to buy a card and the gift card can be used on so many options  Your gift recipient is bound to find exactly what they want
__label__Negative	I placed my order on Friday Dec 7th selecting the free 1 day shipping According to info I got from my orders page on Amazon they didnt send them out til the next day Now its Thursday Dec 13th and I still havent gotten them They are in Dallas and at least 12 more days away from me I ordered 13 cards for my nieces and nephews who live all over the country and I wanted to add a hand written note to each card before mailing them out Next year Ill just give them cash or gift cards that I dont have to order online This is so wrong especially since I did 95 of my holiday shopping this year almost 2000 on Amazon and Ive got a Prime membership on top of that This is the first problem Ive had with Amazon ever but it just might cause me to shop elsewhere for gifts from now on
__label__Positive	Bought this for my grandma for Christmas and she loved it Bought her a 50 Cracker Barrel gift card one year as well She eats there every week so this bought her breakfast for a few weeks
__label__Negative	Huge scam Do NOT buy this If you read the fine print on the card it says card must be first activated by a cashier I assumed they would activate these for us but nope Completely useless I just wasted 100 of my money Im not sure why there is so many positive reviews because these gift cards are a complete scam Please dont make the same mistake I did
__label__Positive	I received the gift card within 10 minutes via email very quick
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always a sure thing when gifting an older teen or family member  It is so easy through Amazoncom
__label__Positive	Daughter got a kick out of it but really loved the gift part
__label__Positive	We needed a quick gift for a teenagers party and this worked perfect
It prints in a nice card format not just a sheet with a code
Would definitely use it again
__label__Positive	these were bought for gifts because it is what they asked for since they had gotten them before  liked them
__label__Positive	Really works
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Card arrived on the date promised   for which I was thankful because I had waited until the last minute to order a gift card for my grandson
__label__Positive	Was great
__label__Negative	The chain is nice looking but I thought I would be getting a chain that was more smooth and polished  and would not cut into you skin when moved around on the neck I could not discern from the picture the finish on the chain Would like to trade it in
__label__Positive	Great gifts for teachers and anyway that deserves a little appreciation
__label__Positive	OK1
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are a great idea and my niece was thrilled to receive one for her birthday
__label__Positive	Fine
__label__Positive	These are loved by everyone
__label__Positive	The receiver in this case was a reader of books They were thrilled with the ability to use the gift card for new book purchases

Also the Nativity scene was very nice as it is a depiction of the true meaning of Christmas
__label__Positive	One of my favorite presents to receive is a Amazon gift card Amazon had everything your heart desires The one thing I would like to change would enable you to use the gift card on certain purchases and to put household purchases such as vitamins cereal cleaning items on your amazon charge That way you could use the gift card on things that you truly want Dish detergent does not make a good present Books do
__label__Positive	I like the Amazon Gift Card my grand children are getting older and like to pick out their own gifts The gift cards are easy to select for any occasion Our  grand kids are constantly on Amazoncom and are looking for unusual items
__label__Positive	Had to have a gift for a 16 year old relative  Amazon to the Rescue  Chose the amount printed the card and mailed it in the birthday card Easy simple and greatly appreciated
__label__Positive	nice gift
__label__Positive	I like giving gift cards to Hard to shop for family members because they are never too tight in the hips
__label__Positive	Was easy
__label__Negative	awful flimsy brittle broke after the first week  would not buy again and would not recommend I saw no benefit or phone protection
__label__Positive	Excellent product did the job for broken wrist recovery
__label__Positive	In a pinch  FORGOT THE TEACHER GIFT LIKE I DID  Here you go perfect  My daughters teacher is an avid reader and I saw on her Facebook she was looking forward to reading on the beach  Its a no brainer  Instant purchase prints beautifully
__label__Positive	awesome
__label__Positive	the person who received it was so happy and excited  It made their night at work grave yard shift on Christmas go by fast
__label__Positive	I was satisfied
__label__Positive	worked perfectly 
__label__Positive	Gave to my son and sure he has made good use of itsure he made good use of it  tx
__label__Positive	My grandson loved the ecard and the ability to shop for his present online I will be doing this again for xmas presents Thanks Amazon

__label__Positive	This is a great alternative to picking for someone as a gift since Amazon has such a wide range of things to choose from
__label__Positive	Awesome deal 40 for a 50 card Lightening deals are great
__label__Positive	This is a very cool way to present an Amazon gift card The box has magnetic closures in it that work well It looks just like an Amazon shipping box
__label__Positive	Perfect gift Who doesnt love an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Is what it is and a great gift
__label__Positive	Love the store
__label__Positive	Right color  size always
__label__Positive	Great idea especially when I didnt get a fathers day card in the mail in time  My soninlaw really appreciated his gift card from Amazon because he can buy anything he wants or needs  Thank you Amazon for making my life easier
__label__Positive	Very nice
__label__Positive	Its a gift card so not much to review but the niece loved it and a easy way to send something for a small holiday rather than candy or junk
__label__Positive	We Would like to be able to customize the message as well as picture  other wise great gift card product
__label__Positive	great

__label__Positive	What more could someone ask for An Amazon gift card gives the receiver so many possibilities  Some people say gift cards are lazy  I couldnt disagree more  By giving an Amazon gift card I just opened up many different possibilities for you  I love Amazon and want to share that with my friends and family

__label__Negative	This is great gift card And I guess inclement weather played a factor in still not recieving an item that was ordered on 1221 It is usually a two day mail ride from Colorado to Cali Next time I will just goto our local Safeway and pick them up in person Just goes to shows doesnt pay or save to be lazy I wasnt able to give Christmas gift to daughter on time and she has so far done without Well maybe they will be here in the next day or three One thing for sure I wont order gift cards from Gift Card Mall again Their conveneince weighs too much on the pyshce

__label__Positive	AMAZING Teddy Bear So close to lifelike that it scares people who see it

Seriously Yesterday I had a friend come over take a look at the teddy bear screech and pass out When she came to I showed her the tags to prove it wasnt real

If you have ever lived among real Teddy Bears you will know just from the picture how life like this is Even the mits and hat are spot on

I bought this only for the teddy bear I didnt need the gift certificate so I tossed that
__label__Positive	My friend loved it
__label__Positive	I gave this as a gift  The receiver was very happy with it and really liked the snowflake tin
__label__Negative	Everybody  love and find this a helpful gift delivery  time was really fast but the main complain  I  have is that the card both of them where completely  bended  so the cute card was ruined it and the card itself too so I  know is going to  still work but is terrible giving someone a bended  card as a gift
__label__Positive	Terrific food well prepared  served Go early or call ahead
__label__Negative	I successfully purchased this Ulta gift card and it came in a jiffy Christmas came happy thoughts were had happy faces were made A few weeks later the gift recipient planned her shopping trip and tried to buy what fit her fancy The gift card was declined She was told to call Ulta customer service Ulta told her to call Amazon customer service Amazon told her they dont activate cards She called Ulta againthey gave her a number to the company who activates gift cards which was not of course not in service Smoke
and mirrors sweet lads

__label__Positive	Great gift card and money holder for my wedding It simple with a good design and it large enough for a good number of cards Would reccommend so that your gifts cards and envelopes from family and friends do not just have to lay on a table or possibly get blown away espcially if you are having an outdoor wedding
__label__Positive	Good value These bears turn out to be great decorations beside other gifts under a Christmas tree  So soft and adorable More pictures attached to show the actual size  LOVE THEM

__label__Negative	If I could give it zero stars I would You may be going this will never happen to me but it will I have had the same problems as everyone here this is not a good I am in a buy save up your money
__label__Negative	You sign in go to kindle create a gift card put in your amount
and the trouble begins You put in your visa card number doesnt
matter if it is already on file you go through more continues
then purchase and Amazon tells you that your gift card is ready
to print Try to print it Amazon asks you for your credit card number
AGAIN Press the print gift card button and you get an html file
which is the Amazon signin panel This is what Amazon downloads
YOU GET NO GIFT CARD Customer service was very cooperative
and gave me a refund said they would fix the problem
__label__Positive	shipping and handling was on point as expected
__label__Positive	Next Day Delivery was Great  Nice gift wrapped box and cute gift card  I have ordered these gift cards in the past and I am Always pleased 
__label__Negative	The card failed to print  Tried it several times and it seems the file was corrupted  Called customer service who could not help even after several conversations with her supervisor  Finally gave up and asked for a credit  Only thing she could do was transfer the amount to a gift card account for myself which has limitations on its use  For my intended gift I just wrote a check which is not likely to spent with Amazon
__label__Positive	It paid for stuff
__label__Positive	An Amazon gift card is just the right gift card for holidays  I order them for birthdays  Christmas  I know who ever I give the card to will enjoy shopping for what they want  Amazon

__label__Positive	Love giving and receiving Amazon gift cards For the person who is hard to buy for this is the answer
__label__Neutral	This was a gift I sent I found difficulty in navigating the site to put in the information for the receipient and when they received it didnt know who I sent the gift for Also I wasnt able to send a note with the gift This stops me from sending gift cards

__label__Positive	Ive gotten so many compliments on how awesome this box looked  There have even been suggestions for how many other uses this box had  A very nice tin indeed

__label__Positive	Love that I can send a movie gift card and they receive it instantly Great way to send a gift
__label__Negative	the person that was supposed to receive it never did plain and simple perhaps if it did arrive i might have rated it better
__label__Positive	Fits the bill
__label__Neutral	A gift card is a great idea for computer literate people Unfortunately I bought a gift card for someone on his 80th birthday Although he uses the computer regularly he left the credit with Amazon for months until I finally visited him and spent the gift card online with his wifes suggestion He was only happy when the merchandise arrived at his door  All in all I will still use this as a gift idea in the future but will save it for those who will enjoy spending it After all its really takes little effort to use
__label__Positive	exelenrte
__label__Positive	This makes a great Christmas gift for any book reader especially with a Kindle
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Negative	WHY AM I UNABLE TO BUY A GIFT CARD BECAUSE MY ACCOUNT BALANCE IS SITTING THERE TO BE USED FROM AN AMAZON  CARD TO ME WHICH AMAZON RECEIVED ACTUAL PAYMENT FROM THE PERSON THAT GAVE IT TO ME WHY ARE YOU DICTATING WHAT I CHOOSE TO PURCHASE WITH WHAT BELONGS TO ME REALLY AMAZON WHAT IS YOUR DEAL AFTERALL THE AMAZON GIFT CARDS I WOULD PURCHASE FOR FAMILY OR FRIENDS COMES BACK TO YOU
__label__Positive	its a giftcard it works got a deal
__label__Positive	Something everyone will love and they dont have to return it
__label__Positive	This card arrived in my email not even 5 minutes after I had ordered it Took it to Dave and Busters and had absolutely no problems using it

Helpful tip screenshot it so you can pull it up from your phone If youre the flipphone type just print it out And if youve never printed anything then what are you even doing here
__label__Positive	I have used this gift card feature many times It always is easy to to print and enclose into a nice card
I love this option
__label__Positive	As expected
__label__Positive	excellent
__label__Positive	I love it is so easy and convenient and my sister could shop and buy what she wants just minutes after I bought it  is the best way to buy gift for Christmas
__label__Positive	What does an 8 year old want for a birthday  Often even parents dont know  Amazon sells just about anything anyone could want  Kids love being able to browse and choose their own stuff
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	I got this from my boyfriend for Christmas for his pets
__label__Negative	I purchased a 10000 gift card as a gift for my brother in March  It was easy to purchase and was then emailed to him directly He printed off the the gift card info  When he went to use it and it had a zero balance  I called and inquired about it and there was nothing Amazon could do  I found out from TGIFrdays that it was used in April in New Jersey Amazon did not refund my money and told me that I needed to contact TGIFridays directly to see if they would refund my money  I have not been successful at getting a refund  After being on the phone for 30 minutes with a customer service agent at Amazon who kept saying she was researching it she finally told me that the gift card department would be in touch  They have not contacted me
__label__Positive	Fun purchase
__label__Negative	This is the 3rd and 4th gift boxes that has been sent WITHOUT the thankyou note I requested If you cant complete a service you shouldnt offer it The recipients thought it was from AMAZON  had no clue it was a thank you from me
__label__Positive	Our friends love getting gift cards from Amazon  so easy to do and wellappreciated too We send them each year
__label__Positive	Great gift card Birthday boy was thrilled
__label__Positive	Parents enjoyed it
__label__Positive	When you dont know what gift to buy someone a gift card comes in handy Obviously it gives the receiver the option of purchasing whatever they want It can seem impersonal but I would rather that then buy someone something that they dont want or wont use
__label__Positive	Love my Amazon gift card Wish there was a setting that would make it only use the gift when I make kindle purchases and not use for everything Oh well

__label__Positive	I wanted a gift ecard that people could use for pretty much whatever they wanted which the Amazon gift card is  It was for someone who I didnt know personally but had helped out our organization in a significant way  So I wanted a cover  card that said thank you in a professional way that is it was not too flowery  This seemed to be the best cover card option I would have like to have seen a few more options to choose from but this was fine  The gal who received it was very appreciative of it the best part was that she didnt expect it at all
__label__Negative	Did not meet my expectations the Birthday Gift card  arrived in good time but was NOT in a gift box was just in an envelope

__label__Negative	As of Dec 21 2016 Once purchased the email tells you to click the button print a copy and take it to the store 1 I dont want to go to a store 2 What store Certainly not Amazon or Netflix Normally they used to send an access code you go to Netflix to activate Not todaya datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefNetflixGiftCardEmailDeliverydpB01730QPK8refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txtieUTF8Netflix Gift Card  Email Deliverya
__label__Positive	IT WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT TO MY DAUGHTER IN LAW IN OCTOBER  THEY ALWAYS ENJOY NETFLIX  THANKS
__label__Positive	To be honest I do not like Build A Bear but since I already had some gift cards but not enough to take both of my kids this was just what I was looking for  Honestly 45 is about enough for one kid because the addon are numerous and the store has perfected their sales pitch to children
__label__Positive	Graduate loved it
__label__Positive	My friend lives in another state so being able to make this gift quick and easy was very convenient for me
__label__Positive	Amazing amazon GC

__label__Positive	Quick no fees great choice for a gift It was received instantly and I got immediate confirmation Definitely would do more
__label__Negative	what the heck The lightning deal is waitlisted as soon as it went live Such a waste of time
__label__Positive	Good gift idea for kids that have everything
__label__Negative	gift card would only apply to my account no who I was giving the card to
__label__Positive	My niece loved it she is 15 and its better than giving her cash she bought jewelry with it 
__label__Positive	Email your teacher giftsquick and easy on the last day of school  Love this
__label__Positive	Just half the gift card is covered with photo and there were very limited online Christmas theme choices The prior year UPS claimed a computer glitch that cause nondelivery on the promise date This year Amazon shut off delivery well before by Christmas eve because of UPS being overwhelmed by deliveries I was forced to give them a email card both years  Rather impersonal so you must feel very fortunate that I allowed you a rating as high as fourstar
Sincerely  Bill Wright
__label__Positive	Amazon offers so many Gift Card options that I am sure everyone can find something good
__label__Positive	excellent
__label__Positive	Gift

__label__Positive	Great way to send a gift card
__label__Positive	So easy for the last minute gift no postage costs and the recipient can choose a product at their leisure
__label__Positive	My daughter loved it for her birthday

__label__Positive	Very happy with it
__label__Positive	great gift idea
__label__Positive	Its a great gift idea when your children live in different countries and postage is expensive and unreliable
__label__Positive	Easy and fun
__label__Positive	I got these gift cards shipped for free got them after a couple of days and they activated just fine Most of my shopping is done on Amazon these days anyway and everything was great Heck I would have paid more in taxes and gas to buy these at some store

Amazon does their gift cards well and they make a perfect small gift to those people you dont know what to get
__label__Negative	As a Christmas gift the idea was for it to be delivered on Christmas eve It was not delivered on time Had to have it sent again Its only  so nothing special about the gift itself The timing was the only thing that mattered and it didnt happen Very disappointed
__label__Positive	Love the gift cardsfast delivery via email
__label__Positive	Everyone loves an Amazon gift card  Everything you could want
__label__Positive	Love Amazon gift cards

__label__Positive	This is always a simple and easy gift to give to that person in your life who is always picky or fussy  I would recommend this and it will save you a lot of time looking for the right gift
__label__Positive	I bought this gift box so I could reuse it for myself Sometimes gift boxes themselves are great for second uses and this is one of them

It is a miniature Amazon shipping box I think its incredibly cute Inside there is a piece of plastic molded to hold your plastic gift card in place You can easily remove it and use it for other purposes However this is a tiny box so it can be used for only so many things I use mine to store gift cards to be used later Why use it to store one card when it can be used to store more

This gift box is great to give to others or keep for yourself Recommended
__label__Positive	It was so easy to get this gift card  Great idea for gifts for anyone

__label__Positive	I love everything about my new mirror Looking forward to being able to take it with me on vacation Its the perfect mirror for make up and the lighting is especially nice The suction cup is a nice addition Im very happy with my purchase
__label__Positive	What is there not to love
__label__Negative	I chose this rating due to the fact that my account was debited for 50 dollars and i give it to my daughter as a xmas present and she couldnt redeem it now im out of pocket not only the 500000 but i had to give her the money to obtain the gift herself
__label__Positive	Yum
__label__Positive	Just perfect
__label__Positive	Easy quick and prompt
__label__Positive	Loved it and so did my friends
__label__Positive	Its very nice to be able to send a gift card when you are unsure of what to give as a gift  It always arrives when it says it will and the person receiving it can choose what they like not what you think they will like
__label__Positive	Wirked perfect  Was the right part we needed
__label__Negative	There was suppose to be a message with it telling who it was from

__label__Positive	There are very few things I have bought by Amazon that have disappointed me It is an online company that provides excellent service These gif card I have drawn from many troubles
__label__Negative	This gift card maze was shipped broken It was not broken during delivery because the broken plastic pieces were not in the package Huge disappointment and waste of money The metal ball just rolled out of the maze because there was an entire chunk missing out of the side
__label__Positive	My friend loved it So much variety to chose from a fantastic gift idea Quick and easy to purchase minimal effort and maximum impact She was thrilled with it and was able to buy exactly what she wanted She was especially pleased with it because it allowed her to buy something that was not readily available in Australia

__label__Positive	Great birthday and graduation gifts
__label__Positive	Worked great Uploaded a pic to personalize it sent it and it was received very quickly Very convenient and best of all no shipping charge
__label__Positive	Overall satisfied but prices at movie theatures have gone up since my last visit
__label__Positive	Sure gift cards can be seen as easy thoughtless gifts But if you have a friend whose Amazon wish list is a mile long or who lives in another country a gift card is perfect
__label__Positive	This item came according to schedule and was received with enthusiasm What more can you say about a gift card
__label__Positive	worked awesome  very fast email delivery
__label__Positive	I recommend uploading your photo to personalize your gift card  it was easy and fun and it makes the card your own memory
__label__Negative	People love getting these cards usually but we could REALLY use a bigger better selection of the basic card formats  The major complaint however is that often they are not delivered  We have to wait to see if the recipient is just late in thanking us then remember after a few weeks to go check and see if the card was picked up and if not ask for it to be resent  Usually this second attempt works but not always  I think it would be very helpful if we were notified if the card is not picked within a few days of being sent

Other than that a gift card from a site like Amazon is a very useful gift
__label__Positive	I had been invited to join a band because I was likable but wasnt very good at bass I crammed hard taking lessons with Marty regularly He really focused my attention on the basics helping me practice what was essential to getting competent FAST Now years later I am a bassistvocalist that has toured nationally and enjoyed the fruits of playing live music I couldnt have done it with out him
__label__Positive	THNKX SO MUCH
__label__Positive	A hit for Christmas

__label__Positive	Easy to purchase wo guessing what someone might want Youll save time Recipiant will be happy they can purchase through the empire Jeff B  made The cool thing is it comes w a free mintno it doesnt but wouldnt it be nice if Jeff B did his share in starting a world wide campaign in the fight against halitosis  A free breathe mint w the purchase of an Amazon card might really be the beginning

they love Amazon as much as I do
__label__Positive	Perfect This is a gift for my niece I was nervous about ordering a gift card online but i checked the balance upon receipt and the available balance is correct

__label__Positive	My daughter and soninlaw are Amazon junkies like I am  I ordered the gift cards online they arrived at my home within 34 days and there were no processing shipping andor handling fees  I wish I could say the same for American Express  Im a lucky woman I received some Amazon gift cards for my birthday and Christmas as well  Thank you Amazon for making it so easy
__label__Positive	I use the gift cards for the birthdays of my coworkers So it is perfect specially to share them with people that work in other countries
__label__Positive	Love Amazon gift cards and the timely arrival at my door
__label__Positive	Cool
__label__Positive	Convenient gift card
__label__Positive	This is a very useful product for me as my brother lives in Seattle But it is also a nice gift to give as he can choose to buy what he wants in this case he put the gift card towards a Kindle
__label__Positive	Very easy and quick Needed a last minute gift for a coworker this was perfect Writing this review was more complicated than acquiring the gift card 
__label__Positive	My daughters current favorite makeup store so she was thrilled
__label__Positive	The wife loves it
__label__Positive	Easy to use gift idea for anyone  You can send it same day and have your gift taken care of
__label__Positive	Great way to give someone something they can use to get what they wantneed
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are a great way of getting those gifts you forgot about ahead of time  I like being able to print them out within a few minutes of ordering and having lots of different covers for the printed gift cards
__label__Positive	What can I say All the convenience of a perfectly working gift card with none of the hassle and traffic during the holiday season
__label__Positive	The gift card came beautifully packaged  It was given as a gift so I dont know yet if the recipient had any trouble using it or not  A great gift for the avid reader
__label__Positive	Recipient loved it
__label__Positive	The packaging is so neat  A gift card is a gift card but when you spend more time discussing and looking at the outside and in particular the sprig I think that is pretty special
__label__Positive	Easy way to gift grandchildren and have them pick what they like rather than what I think they ought to like
__label__Positive	Happy with purchase especially next day delivery
__label__Positive	great gift idea
__label__Positive	Running late as usual an important birthday coming upAmazon to the rescue again  Decided to let him choose his own book and be on time and ZAP its there in 10 seconds or less Love you guyssaved my  again
__label__Negative	This was ordered as a Childs gift on December 22 with a next day delivery  it was a week getting to the destination I missed Christmas all together Ridiculous

Never again
__label__Positive	Easy and quick with the ability to have it in a card format made it even better
__label__Positive	Was a little hesitant to purchase these gift cards due to previous reviews stating that they didnt work in store I got 2 for my mom for Mothers Day  went with her to the store they worked fine Will purchase again
__label__Positive	I love Regal Cinema there is one close to me so that is where I go to watch movies  This gift card is great to have  It came quickly and just in time
__label__Positive	Like the gift card options
__label__Negative	I dont remember buying this gift card
__label__Positive	It was very easy to upload my photo and give a gift card to my Dad  I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice easy gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift 
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt love this
__label__Positive	When you dont know the happy couple but you want to send a gift any way  an Amazon gift card is the way to go  Painless quick and versatile
__label__Positive	Great and convenient gifts for any occasion Easy to order and always useful
__label__Positive	so excited to give this gift box is awesome
__label__Positive	I bought a 50 dollar gift card for 25 so I cant complain  My wife likes Aero but I hate it  Most of their clothing has their hideously tacky logo plastered across it  It seems their demographic is 14 year olds  I refuse to be a billboard for them
__label__Positive	A gift card from Amazon is always appreciated The receiver has a choice of whatever suits hisher fancy I will use it as a gift again
__label__Positive	Gift card is a gift card and Amazon made the box more usable The window in the back is still there but now it comes glazed with a piece of plastic so you can actually keep things inside Apparently they read reviews at Amazon
__label__Positive	OK this is less a review about the gift card it worked and more about the store itself  I bought a couple of these as gifts based on recommendations from some women who said that Ulta is more a store for well regular people  I was debating a gift card to Sephora but that was nixed since the price points on Sephoras products tend to be really quite high  Ulta on the other hand provided more approachable goods and thus the dollar will go further there  One woman told me that while the Sephora stuff was better it didnt justify the price difference

Of course pure opinion and reasonable people can disagree  That said I gave these out and was greeted with enthusiasm  For that reason I made the switch and will be getting these regularly as gifts  Thanks
__label__Positive	My friend enjoys his coffee
__label__Positive	enjoyable
__label__Positive	Makes shopping easy
__label__Positive	Clean presentation lighting quick delivery
__label__Negative	First I know it seems silly to be downrating a gift card but bare with me  I picked this design specially because I could color it in  But what I wasnt expecting was that you cant fold it like all of the other Amazon gift cards  When you print this its a full 85x11 inches  Not really what I was expecting for a gift card that I was giving to family for Christmas
__label__Positive	bien
__label__Positive	Great Christmas gift for someone far away or hard to shop for
__label__Negative	was trying to purchase for someone else but the credit posted to my pagewhatever I used it myself
__label__Positive	Very Cute gift card that can be used for any occasion Giraffes and hearts on the cover Get it now

How do I return cards that  subway that were enclosed but had no balance on them
I asked for the olive garden and the subway cards to be returned to me
__label__Positive	There is nothing special about a gift card except that Im glad to have the option to purchase one for a gift when your not sure what someone wants It was so quick and easy sitting right here at home So if your not sure what to get someone this will be a great idea and Amazon has everything so a person can use the card on whatever they like THANKS

__label__Positive	I think a lot of people just dont know how Fandango operates Yes you will get charged a convenience fee if you use Fandango just like ticketmaster Fandango doesnt make any money from the tickets they sell at all A lot of people do not know that If you think thats not an option for you you could also use your AMC stubs to waive the convenience fee if you think that is not worth Thats what I do Convenience fees are waived and I have the the luxury and convenience to skip lines in the theater It makes everything super easy Fandango makes movie going such a an awesome experience and I would highly recommend these gift cards I actually bought this gift card for my mom and she couldnt be anymore happy

__label__Positive	Satisfied
__label__Positive	I love it
__label__Positive	This was the most appreciated gift for my daughters that I have given in years It was also the easiest and reliable
__label__Positive	It was perfect
__label__Negative	I always purchase gift cards and have never had a problem until now This card has a zero balance probably wasnt activated I hope I get my money back Shame on this seller They do not deserve any stars smh
__label__Positive	I was very pleased with these gift cards holiday tins and the quick shipping as well The recipients were quite impressed with the tins and appreciative of their gift cards
__label__Positive	Awesome as usual 
__label__Positive	arrived within 5 min
__label__Negative	We bought this for Audible an Amazon company We were very surprised and disappointed when we found that an Amazon company does not accept Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	Was skeptical after some of the reviews Loaded it to my Starbucks rewards card and it worked no problem Does what it says it should Plus since at the time I was struggling to find discounts on a Starbucks gc Using my discover card through Amazon helped
__label__Negative	I dont know what happened but I wanted to send this to someone and it was sent back to me So the money just sits in my account  I guess
__label__Negative	I was disappointed that the voucher I purchased was not able to be used on the Australian Amazon website
When I paid for the voucher it was converted to Australian dollars but the voucher holder was not able to use it on the Australian website
I did not see anything on the website to inform me of this before or during the purchase process

The receiver of the voucher emailed Amazon support who confirmed that this was the case He then had to transfer the voucher to an American account so that he could use it

I think Amazon need to make vouchers usable no matter what country they are in
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an Amazon gift card  I mean really  The recipient of course loved it and bought something nice for herself  You should do the same
__label__Positive	So convenient and easy I picked it in the last minute and wanted to give the flexibility of choosing their items
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are the best You get all kinds of choices and they go farther for my family and friends
__label__Positive	These are always a great gift when youre having a hard time trying to figure out something to get someone Or for that difficult person to shop for
__label__Positive	They liked it was active more than a gift card
__label__Positive	This was a gift
__label__Positive	Whats to say  
__label__Positive	Its nice to be able to choose the amount and picture rather than just getting a plain gift card from the store
__label__Neutral	Arrived quickly the next day but I gave it 3 stars because the card was not plastic and it was bent Looked as if it wasnt new The Kraft paper was also slightly bent Its cute but looks as if someone folded it
__label__Positive	Very efficient
__label__Positive	Great gift nice card  Easy to buy and to send as a gift for Christmas or any other time of the year
__label__Positive	Great way to send a birthday or holiday gift to a loved one
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	I was looking to get a convenient gift for an 18 year old and this was so easy The gift card comes nicely in the card and in a delivery envelope but you still get an envelope to gift the card The happy birthday card I ordered was really nice and considering it was basically free with the 20 gift card I bought So nice you dont have to go and buy a cardenvelope for the gift card So easy Thanks amazon

__label__Positive	Great No problem at all
__label__Positive	simple to order and easier to send
I was also notified when the recipient opened the gift card Easy and useful gift
__label__Negative	Product was delivered without the personal message I wrote Receiver was not even aware of who it was from
__label__Positive	Always a winner
__label__Positive	This was a gift for my brother Arrived as scheduled and its a great idea by Amazon with everything being electronically distant and detached
__label__Positive	christmas gift
__label__Positive	AmazAmazon gift card yay Of course its 5 stars its money to amazon No one hates amazon its the best gift Why are there even reviews for this

__label__Positive	It was a wonderful Christmas gift  Not just a gift card in envelope
__label__Positive	Exactly what I wanted and delivered on time
__label__Positive	Perfect gift Fast shipping
__label__Positive	I wanted to give the staff at our church a gift of appreciation for their service but it took a while to get some information I wanted before I acted My initial plan was to get gift cards to a large local chain store but I was several states away to visit family and those cards would have required several days for processing if purchased online and mailing to the recipients even though I could have purchased them where I was at an affiliated store It was so easy to have gift cards from Amazon delivered electronically The process was immediate and I got notice both that the orders were completed and when they were received by each recipient I also appreciate that Amazon offers a religiously themed card directly related to the meaning of Christmas rather than just something bland like Happy Holidays The recipients were glad to get Amazon gift cards because they realize they can buy a number of things at Amazon beyond just books I often tell people I bought my new welder through Amazon
__label__Positive	gift
__label__Positive	Totally convenient to order and print and the recipient loved it Would definitely order and print gift cards in the future
__label__Positive	Only Amazon could promise a gift card delivered THE NEXT DAY FREE in the cutest gift tin box All I can say is WOW what fantastic service and my nephew loved it
__label__Positive	Lovely birthday card
__label__Positive	Place an order after 5 seconds to receive the code it is very convenient to use So fast that Ill buy it again
__label__Positive	I loved the ability to create and print the gift card at home  I have also used it for last minute gifts and the recipients love using the card
__label__Positive	It was fun
__label__Positive	Well it fit well in my wallet It was a gift and the money spent well at amazon Didnt work so well at Publix though Now that the money is gone I have no use for it Maybe Ill give it to a cokehead
__label__Positive	Excellent gift for a granddaughter happy birthday
__label__Positive	One of the best gifts I received  Always a pleasure to shop Amazon
__label__Positive	Its a gift card and it works
__label__Positive	Great place to eat
__label__Positive	This was the easiest thing I have ever done The gift email came in minutes and worked like a charm This is the only gift card I buy now because amazon pretty much has everything
__label__Positive	I bought this as a gift for a family member  It is a great gift suggestion
Great for all ages

__label__Positive	As advertised  received on a timely basis
__label__Positive	Cant get much better than an Amazon gift card Its one of the most generic presents that can end up being the most coveted Amazon has absolutely everything and because of that its not looked at at least in my mind as a lazy gift It can be used on anything a person could want so its a great gift for someone so they can get EXACTLY what they want You dont waste money on something they wont use and they are super happy because they get what they want

Also the gift cards and boxes are incredibly high quality and make GREAT presentations and gifts

__label__Positive	It was convenient
__label__Positive	Easy to use fast buying lots of design to choose you can apply it to your amazon account

__label__Positive	Easiest Christmas gift for my niece ever
__label__Negative	The single most annoying gift card i have even purchased Every safeway i went to looked at me like i was crazy Even though the email says the store can can the barcode from your phone the 4 locations i went to couldnt or wouldnt 2 of those locations thought i was trying to pull a fast one on them 1 tried but couldnt get their system to take it Finally the last store the clerk didnt know what i was giving her had to print it out but the realized what it was and didnt have a problem
__label__Positive	Usefull and Workable Is helpfull at moment of keep money at hand in your account to a quick shop thanks

__label__Positive	When it seems like everyone you know has everything they need and you decide to give a gift card then you have to figure out where to get it Amazon gift cards are the best choice For added convenience you can print them at home or email to a friend I love giving and receiving them
__label__Positive	I had a wishing well wedding we just asked for cash and blessings from our guests Which I HIGHLY recommend This bird cage was the answer Our reception was Art Decco themed and this went swimmingly with the room decor We had 110 guests and all but 3 gave us cards with money All the cards fit and it looked so cute My sister decorated it to go along with the theme too Im so glad I purchased this And it is not expensive and arrived very quickly
__label__Positive	This gift always received with gratitude
My sister loved it
__label__Positive	Love the packaging you offer for your gift cards and for no extra charge
__label__Positive	Gift card works like it should
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	Its a car How can you go wrong with that It arrived on time and my in laws were happy with it
__label__Positive	I especially liked the snowflake tin it came in  Easy to identify and not get lost in the pile of wrapping paper
__label__Positive	This was an excellent gift for my sister who has helped me alot lately Thank you
__label__Positive	a
__label__Positive	loved it
__label__Positive	Great Box that is comes in
__label__Positive	My grandson loved his gift card with my personal message  But he especially loved his photo on the front  great idea
__label__Positive	This was a birthday gift and it arrived without paperwork of any kind  My friend had no idea who sent it  She actually had to call amazon to find out  Perhaps I overlooked something when I ordered it but to the best of my memory the only thing offered was a gift receipt  I didnt want that  If Im wrong I apologize to amazon but this lack of packing slips has not made things easier for customers whether ordering for ourselves or others

My friend told me that the minibox is just as adorable in the flesh as it is onscreen
__label__Positive	was a great gift for my mom for mothers day so she can use for her kindle to get more books to read
__label__Positive	My mom lives in California Im in Colorado I love being able to send egift cards
__label__Negative	It did not work sadly I sent a gift card to a friend for groceries and she couldnt redeem the coupon I had to get a refund
__label__Positive	Birthday gift
__label__Positive	this was the perfect gift for my soninlaw  He is quite the reader and would not buy any books before he checks it out on Amazon first  He was quite pleased when he opened his card on Christmas day  Of course he almost lost it because I put it in a pair of house shoes that he also wanted  Thank goodness he did not throw it away with the other papers  He is still shopping
__label__Positive	Who doest like an Amazon gift card in a cupcake tin
__label__Positive	makes for great a gift idea the person I bought this for was thrilled to receive it will continue to buy as gifts as it was such a success
__label__Positive	ITS a gift card  Whats to say
__label__Negative	i ordered three and only received ONE I was not chargedthat  I can see but I wanted all three I am not sure what happened to the other two
__label__Positive	easy
__label__Negative	As a semistarving and incredibly busy student I received the 50 gift card to Panera from my parents I carried it around in my pocket for months and was able to use it twice about 25 maybe  By the time I made it to their store a third time all the valuable information on the card was gone the barcode the super important 9digit ID and the functionality of the magnetic strip  The problem is that barcode and 9digit ID are just painted on to the card and nothing is embossed  After contacting Panera support they want an insane amount of information to issue a new card what store it was purchased at  and some dont count as in they wont support cards purchased many places probably including here at Amazon the last 4 or 5 digits of the ID the receipt and a few other things  I deleted the email yesterday in frustration so Im going by memory

The point  warning here is that you need to be very careful with these cards and  or use them quickly or the paint will come off the magnetic strip will fail and customer service will not help you in any meaningful way  I only gave them 2stars because I like the actual restaurants  Corporate Panera clearly is all about the money and I honestly believe these cards are kind of a trap
__label__Positive	Okay I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this just because of all of the bad reviews but I purchased it anyway There was nothing wrong with this gift card I received it within 510 minutes of ordering DO NOT listen to all of the bad reviews It worked when I redeemed it as well duh lol
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Great birthday gift  Thanks Fast shipping
__label__Positive	Forgot a birthday thats tomorrow  No problem  Amazon even springs for the card and guaranteed next day delivery  And you can write your own message
__label__Positive	Was very satisfied with the quick delivery
__label__Positive	A welcome gift
__label__Positive	This was a gift and the recipient said he enjoyed it

__label__Positive	All good Thanks for a great transaction
__label__Positive	Kids love these cards and gives them the ability to get what they really want
__label__Positive	Very attractive
__label__Positive	Easiest way to send a gift immediately and you will know when it was received Try it and you will see
__label__Positive	Delivered nearly immediately as a verrry lastminute Christmas gift and the hipster deer was chuckleworthy
__label__Negative	I ordered this card on August 22  Amazon didnt process the order until August 30  I thought Amazon owned Whole Foods now  Why did this take so long  This was a wellness award at work so the only reason I ordered it online was because I hate the Whole Foods Store experience  I dont plan to order any other Whole Foods gift cards from Amazon again
__label__Positive	A great gift idea for anybody
__label__Positive	love it

__label__Negative	Well the bear is adorable and the quality you would expect from Gund However when I tried to apply the gift card to my account it showed invalid number error upon chat with Amazon they confirmed they sent the card without activating it and it didnt have any money in it They refunded me the money but what if I had waited on applying it or even worse gifted it to someone So if you buy it just for the bear make sure to check the balance on gift card ASAP
__label__Positive	So convenient  I love shopping on Amazon I hope others do too
__label__Positive	I gave my niece the gift card because she loves to shop on Amazon She loved it It saved me trying to find out what  to get for a gift Im doing this again  What a stress reliever

__label__Positive	Good choice
__label__Negative	you must have US credit card in order to process the order even if you will not buy through the credit card so if you are buying with intenrational credit card it will be a waste of money
__label__Negative	The two gift cards came severely bent up and raggedy looking which is unfortunate since they were intended as gifts  I normally like the convenience of shopping online with Amazon for gift cards etc but this purchase has made me think twice about future purchases

__label__Positive	looked great and works well as a secret santa
__label__Positive	Thanks no problems
__label__Positive	Efficent and speedy
__label__Positive	Fast delivery and perfect for our purposes
__label__Negative	The gift card itself was fine  However Amazons placement of the bar code sticker stinks
The bar code was right across the Peets logo on the cardboard and it could not be removed without tearing the cardboard thereby ruining the presentation
This was a gift for my daughter  The gift looked very second hand with half the logo torn away
Is there some reason the bar code isnt in the BACK of the piece
I wont buy a gift card from Amazon again

__label__Positive	My family never complains about getting an Amazon Gift Card  It is always the latest fashion and it fits without even having to try it on  Amazon makes gift cards easy to buy provides a great variety of designs and lets the purchaser send them by email  So at the midnight hour before the birthday I can give a present that is delivered as soon as the birthday person checks hisher email

__label__Negative	Liked Nothing Gift cards to two separate recipients could not be opened one after many calls to Amazon was finally opened the other recipient was unable to open it and after a number of tries and a number of additional calls to Amazon they said we would receive our 100 refund within 2 days It has now been 30 days and still no refund I would not recommend an Amazon eGift Card They really deserve 0 stars
__label__Negative	DID NOT RECEIVE ANY SUCH 25 GIFT CARD

__label__Positive	An Amazon gift certificate itself is an ideal long distance gift however the notification process really needs to be improved somehow This is the second time Ive given an AMZ gift card that the notification was missed by the recipient
__label__Positive	Super fast delivery at no extra charge Winter design includes plain no design Amazoncom gift card It would be nice to have the Winter greeting card design printed on the Amazon gift card Most of the other sets have the design printed on both the greeting card and the Amazoncom Gift Card This is a great gift
__label__Neutral	The front of the card is fine with a nice colorful picture and a simple message of Happy Mothers Day But the inside and back of the card have a lot of extra text and barcodes that are sort of an eye sore and dont leave much room for a hand written message  It also didnt print that well but I think that was a problem with my printer not the design of the card
__label__Positive	Bought this for my 9 year old nephew and he loved the animation not to mention the money
__label__Positive	We love giving gift cards Always appreciated
__label__Positive	Excellent for last minute gifting

I cannot speak for the menu or food quality of the actual restaurant as I dont eat there myself but as an easy quick gift in a nice box it did its job well

__label__Positive	Anytime you can help with inflated airfare costs irs a good thing
__label__Positive	We bought these as end of the year teacher gifts What teacher or anyone for that matter cant use something on Amazon I wanted to get them something they could use either personally or for their classroom without buying another little trinket that just sits on a shelf They were the perfect amount some gift cards are too high or low in price This was an easy and great gift to give

__label__Positive	Great idea for a gift They can get what they want and its always delivered on the special day
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Negative	100 in gift cards for 130 Umm
__label__Negative	I bought this Fandango card as a Lightning Deal  As others have noted Fandangos fees quickly eat away the discount

But even worse once you grudgingly accept the fees the thing is hard to use  Last night I tried to use it at the box office of an AMC cinema  No of course the card doesnt work that way you can only reserve tickets onlinebut I wanted to try  When that failed I tried to use my phone to reserve a ticket with the card on Fandangos mobile app  Youre asked to enter the card number  it is 19 digits long  A hasslebut  the field will only hold 18 digits  And then there is a PIN  It is four digits long but you guessed it the field for the PIN only holds three digits

Many of the positive reviews here seem to come from giftgivers who got a deal on Fandango cards  You spend 40 and you give 50  Sounds great

Many of the negative reviews come from folk like me who try to use the card  The face amount starts to disappear in fees and as I describe above sometimes you cant use the card at all

Giftgivers  please scan these reviews for user experiences  Whatever the alleged face value of the card are the experiences described the kind you want associated with you or your business
__label__Positive	Love giving them as well as receiving them and my childrem share my feelings which is one reason I can afford to shop at Amazon

__label__Neutral	I was disappointed that my order didnt seem to go thru for the birthday on May 24th  As I was checking my credit card bill I notice the charge didnt appear and when I checked on it with the receipiant I was told she had never received itspoiling the surprise  Now if Amazon would have let me know it didnt go through I could have corrected it faster

__label__Positive	Only the joy it gave to a precious young mom on mothers day
__label__Positive	The perfect Get out of jail free card I wonder how much was spent on these in the run up to Christmas

__label__Positive	Who doesnt like coffee

__label__Positive	Perfect white elephant Christmas item  Everybody wanted this gift card  Especially because it came in a little amazon box  Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	So easy although I do think you should be able to receive some kind of a discount for giving them your money ahead of time Especially when you consider that a good number of people lose their cards and then Regal gets to keep the money as 100 profit  But its a good enough looking card and its easy to send as a gift
__label__Positive	Awesome and delivered in a day
__label__Positive	It is just a paper print out Nothing fancy but I was able to purchase and print the gift card within 20 minutes Very convenient

__label__Positive	I wish I would have been able to choose the amount I wanted instead of having to choose the amounts they have available
__label__Negative	Absolutely awful customer service We received a 25 Fandango gift card and went to purchase prepaid tickets online The site kept saying our card number and claim code are invalid I then called customer service was hung up on and then told to use the 16 digit card number However the card number we had was 19 digits When I tried to explain this I was told it should be 16 digits and was not advised any further I will never purchase anything from Fandango and highly suggest to anyone thinking about using their service to think again

__label__Neutral	1 Card cost 25 In beginning of order no mentioning about 349 charge for Gift Wrap It was Birthday Present to teenage granddaughter addition to Starbucks card who charged extra 299 for delivery All this cards for sale everywhere WITHOUT extra charges Amazon should do the same Or be reasonable in extra charges for piece of plastic
2 I wanted Gift Wrap because expected to ship together 2 plastic cards in one box But it was ship separate and no box was needed Please return to me 299 Starbucks Card shipping and 349 Subway Card gift wrap
3 Also please send email picture of Gift Wrap that was mailed to my granddaughter Jacqueline Candella with Subway Card inside

__label__Positive	I got this gift card for my daughters birthday and she received it really fast  She was very happy with the card because she loves CPK  The great thing about this order is that it was filled by Amazon thats why I think she received it so quickly
__label__Negative	The link to get the gift card number did not work for me Seems like a technical issue I wrote to Amazon who directed me to contact Whole Foods I did Whole Foods asked me the gc number I said I couldnt get it due to an error of the link I then contacted Amazon again and they dont seem to know the issue I have to tell them many times that I could not get my gc number  Finally after weeks of effort I got this message

__label__Negative	I asked for a small gift box but instead got a crappy piece of wrapping around the card dont chose that option I was charged 2
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with a gift card nothing easier and those that receive them can get what they want no fuss
__label__Positive	We are using for a Christmas gift to relatives

__label__Positive	Had the card to the Next day
__label__Positive	My granddaughter loved this birthday present including the birthday cupcake card
__label__Positive	Quick and easy to make
__label__Positive	Kindle gift cards are great presents for readers Easy to buy easy to print and always loved by everyone who Ive ever given one to
__label__Negative	Worst experience Received a 100 card and when I went to use it a few months later the restaurant said it had been used by someone else in another part of the State After a number of calls with the main office nothing was done and I was out 100
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Since Netflix itself does not offer an option on their site to buy a yearly subscription just bought a few of these and loaded them to my account Theyll send you reminders when your card balances are low giving you time to reload
__label__Positive	Easy and practical gift
__label__Positive	It was a much appreciated gift to a dear friend
__label__Positive	Always good choice
__label__Positive	great Simple easy and fast  love love love lovelove love love love love love love love love love love love
__label__Positive	Ive been giving these cards for several years and the key advantage is free overnight delivery and price flexibility so far none of those Ive ordered in 3 years have been delayed  The card is heavy stock the printing design is classy for the most finicky recepient so If you dont know what to give this is perfect
__label__Positive	Bought this for my BrotherinLaw  Quick easy and effective  I love this option  Its my preferred method of sending gift cards if I dont have time to wait for the mail
__label__Positive	The person I sent it to love it He got it in hid email with no problem and has use it a lot thanks again for taking care of it for me
__label__Positive	good choice
__label__Positive	Great idea for someone who lives far away Definitely recommend
__label__Positive	Its a greaf gift for my sons
__label__Positive	My daughter was very happy with her gift card
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	excellent item quick delivery
__label__Positive	When you want to give someone a gift and dont know what that someone would like give a gift that enables that someone to buy what he or she wants  Perfect way to give what they want without having to know what it is or shop for it

Ordered on line received immediately  Cant get much better than that
__label__Positive	The perfect gift and the best card to go with it
__label__Positive	They are a good Product and I will Use them thank you for your quick response
__label__Positive	What better way to give a gift card at your friends favorite restaurant than to get it at a discounts which means you can buy something extra for your friend
__label__Negative	Like some others who posted reviews this gift card was not activated or valid A very unacceptable scenario particularly as this was a gift
__label__Positive	What I liked ease of selection fitness for purpose flexibility of end use
__label__Positive	I purchased two 5000 cards for both of my daughters and they loved them Delivered quickly and let me know whenever they were viewed
__label__Positive	An amazing perfect Christmas gift for my grandbabies They were very happy just looking at the penguins The best way to spend it exactly on  what they really need
__label__Positive	Great gift card loved it simple but funny these amazons gift cards are the best and the funniest for a gift
__label__Positive	i sent the hoops and yoyo gift card to my neice and she loved itcant go wrong with hoops and yoyo
__label__Positive	Given as a gift to a relative
__label__Positive	A
__label__Positive	Xmas stocking stuffer Loved it
__label__Positive	Went through right away
__label__Positive	excellent card
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Negative	Sender forgot to include my gift msg My recipient didnt know WHO sent her this gift card
__label__Positive	To all those who have family away and want to give a present this is what you need Thats it
__label__Neutral	My order was for a birthday gift certificate to be sent to my email address for me to hand deliver It never arrived as a print friendly item I received confirmation of purchase but no gift certificate I twice requested you to resend the gift in printable form and again received confirmations but no printable form Finally I changed the delivery email address to the designated recipient That seems to have worked although I have never seen the gift certificate
__label__Positive	The card is simple and gives enough room to write I was glad it doesnt have the price on it so it is a surprise to the person who receives it I am giving them to teachers I was able to put the amount I wanted verse the amounts they have in the general grocery stores I like having a greeting card with a gift card and not having to buy one
__label__Positive	It was a perfect gift for some wonderful friends  I had great luck with it  So thank you very much
__label__Positive	The design is excellent and Amazon gift cards are always welcome  However it took an inordinate number of days to arrive when it was supposed to be next day  The cards I purchased 4 or 5 were actually delivered 5 days later  I was surprised at this because with a distribution center about 12 miles from our house I am used to getting everything within a day or two
__label__Positive	Very useful  I recommend
__label__Positive	An easy to acquire gift for someone who likes to do online shopping I like how you can print it out on your computer and have it within seconds
__label__Positive	Real fast
__label__Positive	great price and even better delivery
__label__Positive	Whats better than an Amazon GC Recipient can get anything they wantfrom lots and lots of items to choose from
__label__Positive	ty
__label__Positive	Good Quality
__label__Positive	Fastest way to send a money gift through the mail
__label__Positive	Just as I expected
__label__Positive	The best purchase for anyone who has ever said wait a sec the party is tomorrow  Seriously Ive stocked up on these  well worth it on those crazy days when you just didnt have time to run out and buy a present or dont even have enough time to get a gift from Amazon even with overnight shipping
The boxes alone are worth more than 500 for three They are cute reusable and appropriate for any agegender The bow is attached only to the top lid making this an easyopen present You dont even need wrapping paper and to be honest it looks a darn sight nicer than just printing out a paper gift certificate
All in all a great idea
__label__Positive	Fun design Friend loved the gift of course
__label__Negative	I ordered this gift online and chose the card vs printing as it said it was 24 hr shipping I did not receive it until 4 days later I had to go back in and order the printable version for a gift thinking the other was lost Not happy
__label__Positive	Easy to use
__label__Positive	Wanted Christian card design and this was the only one offered
__label__Positive	Whats not to like
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	Made a great presentation And the value of Amazon is always worth it
__label__Positive	Granddaughter was happy
__label__Positive	Dont have words to describe how easy and wonderful the gift card is  Thanks
__label__Negative	I read the reviews below and thought there was no way to mess up an order as easy as this Clearly I was mistaken the tin was bent scratched and obviously well worn I would find another option than to use these as good an idea as it may seem
__label__Negative	Bought it n 10292017 tried to use it on 01132018 and the restaurant said it does not work
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for the mailman who delivers all my Amazon purchases
__label__Positive	Great easy to use
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	Mmmmm
__label__Positive	a FAVORITE WATERING HOLE FOR THE RECIPIENT RECEIVING THIS GIFT CARD
__label__Positive	A great way to say Happy Birthday to a grandchild who has everything Easy to send and easy to receive
__label__Positive	After purchasing 2 gift cards for a Christmas gift 1 of the cards was not activated a replacement card was sent immediately upon notification
__label__Positive	A birthday present
__label__Positive	When you dont know what to get someone a gift card is a perfect way to give  They can get exactly what they want
__label__Positive	Was a Christmas gift for a dear friend They loved it Its a lot better giving a gift card that way the person can buy exactly what they want Much better than buying something and risking them not liking the gift
__label__Negative	I did not receive my gift card This was supposed to be a fast email delivery and that was my expectation
__label__Positive	Due to the fact that one of my daughters lives in Australia and the other lives in another part of the US the ability to give them something at Christmas that was both easy and practical was necessary for me
The ability to send them a Amazon Gift Card through a link in Facebook was very easily done and was a total surprise to both of them They couldnt have been happier
__label__Negative	I only received 2 of the gift cardsI ordered and paid for 4

__label__Positive	Emailed as promised  Great Deal 
__label__Neutral	Wow Just got these as a gift I have used gift cards before With those you just go to the course when you play and give them the card and they debit it With these you have to book the tee time yourself unless you want a 500 charge for them doing it only within their specified hours Then you have to fill out a form on their website and in return they will call the course and pay 24 hrs before you show up May be petty but its more to do to get a tee time Let alone if you need to cancel

__label__Positive	How do I know if this was picked up  There should be away to know if this gift was received
__label__Negative	First I liked the book because I was great fan Stanwyck but then I got to the end and I would give it now a NG rating  It left me hanging with nothing about the end of her marriage to Taylor and the rest of her life  Before I read another bio  I want to know before I beging if it is going to be a complete one

__label__Positive	Who doesnt love Amazon

__label__Positive	whats not to love

__label__Positive	I purchased gift cards for my associates as a holiday gift  It was easy to purchase print and include in a card

__label__Positive	Always better to let the recipient have the option of what they want I like gift cards for that reason
__label__Positive	always makes a good gift
__label__Positive	I dont know why there are so many negative reviews Clearly some people didnt know how to actually use the Egiftcard because I received it within 5 minutes and I had no issues at checkout
__label__Negative	If you order more than one gift card and they are for different amounts when they arrive you cant tell one from the other  I guess Amazon thinks that we are either only going to order one card or that if we are ordering more than one that they will all be for the same dollar amount  Guess what  Thats not how the world works  You flunked at this  What a pain
__label__Positive	No problem with this cant complain
__label__Positive	Whats to say Was an email gift card fast delivery
__label__Positive	This was just what I needed for one of my Christmas presents  Came in the mail and fit the bill for one of my daughters presents as she loves Amazoncom

__label__Positive	Always have a difficult time buying for grandchildren out of town  With Amazon gift cards they can pick out their own gifts and what they need or would like to have  Also saves cost of mailing items through the Post Office or UPS  My 5 year old granddaughter loves receiving a gift card from Amazon and sitting with her daddy to select what she would like to have picking out her toys or new clothing and what color she would like
__label__Negative	The gift card is fine but it was supposed to be here on 916 and it didnt get here until 5 on the 918  I know I could have had an email sent to my nephew but I wanted to take something to the party  917  I gave my nephew the gift card today
__label__Positive	I chose this five star rating for Amazon gift cards because it was so easy to purchase and send to your recipient Amazon is great because of the great variety of items you can choose to purchase

__label__Neutral	Simple only if you have a Amazon gift card you want use and cant figure what you want then buy this That what I exactly what I did I usually dont buy it from here cause your paying extra I dont recommend it if you paying with your own debit or credit card
__label__Neutral	Earned no thank you from the recepitient although I know it was received The younger generation seems to expect more and appreciate it less

__label__Negative	O cards do not work
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	I finally got an electronic book I wanted one for a while It has been an adjustment to get used to the Kindle but I am managing The best part is having a book take up so little space be so readable and have connectivity to a hot spot for more downloads and updates Oh the best is the page holderI usually turn down the page corner on paper books and tapping the corner marks my spot for the next session Love it

The least liked item is the sensitivity of the screen I sometimes move the page way forward and dont know how I did it The reverse or page back not always goes one page at a time I miss having the instruction booklet in paper form to refer to for instructions in a time like that

My elderly mom could not manage the Kindle at all Her arthritic fingers were all over the screen when not wanting to be an could not read with it More time for me

I am looking forward to getting to know my Kindle Touch better with use It is great
__label__Positive	With Christmas quickly approaching and I still having a large shopping list to fill I turned to Amazons gift cards for help There are many different card values to choose from so theres a card for anyone They can be used for anything at Amazon so the gift choices are unlimited And because its Amazon you get them fast and free I expected nothing less
__label__Positive	Mom loved it
__label__Positive	Recipient was surprised great gift for a computer guy whos always there for you to help 40 gets you 50 only you have to spend the extra 10 No real savings Money Walks
__label__Positive	good

__label__Positive	The perfect gift
__label__Positive	thank you
__label__Positive	Great gift Love Chilis
__label__Positive	There were difficulties with the gift card but none of them were from Amazon  I was told that the gift card had not been received and Amazon resent it promptly  Again I was told it had not been received but it was in the email and found after a close search of over 100 emails that had built up  Amazoncom has NEVER let me down on any order
__label__Positive	Got this as a gift for a great family friend It was exactly what she wanted She was pleased and I was pleased how easy it was to send it to her
__label__Positive	I find it do silly that they ask us to rate gift cards
1 It looked like a gift card
2 It was received by the intended recipient
3 That person usedspent it
4 Everyone was happy
5 The end
__label__Positive	Love the tin for this gift card  especially for a guy  Love the Gift Bag which is heavy duty  Did not like the unprofessional message printing attached gift tag which was very much off centered on the tag print was faded  very small and hard to read  First time ordering like this so sent to my house to see how they would appear for future reference  gift tag printing needs some work with Amazon for professionalism  Otherwise this is a great and quick gift idea
__label__Positive	Why not have a themed gift card
__label__Positive	How do you go wrong on a gift card No complaints other than the printing was weird
__label__Positive	It is a gift card it works and came quickly

9 more words required because my review is that awesome
__label__Positive	easy way of buying things its faster than a credit card because the payment its already at amazon excelent for a gift
__label__Positive	Loved the gift
__label__Positive	Its very fast
__label__Positive	The cupcake gift card holder was a very cute design My granddaughter loved it Just wish there had been a receipt in the box showing how much was on the card
__label__Positive	My sister is making good use of her birthday gift card with her Kindle She lives on an Island and mailing presents can cost more than the present Much better a gift card she can use online
__label__Positive	Its the perfect thing for a granddaughters birthday
__label__Positive	BJs Restaurant isnt everywhere but is an excellent place to eat and I and my significant other got this for my motherin law and his mother for mother day
__label__Positive	Whats not to love about a gift certificate Was given as a birthday gift better than cash or a check because wont be used for paying bills instead of allowing oneself to treat themselves to items they might not have purchased otherwise
__label__Positive	was well recieved as a gift
__label__Negative	The backing is ripped and taped The card is nowhere near in the right spot I would never give this as a gift And there are no returns
__label__Positive	Very quick service and very easy
__label__Positive	Very cute and cozy My daughter loves it
__label__Negative	I have purchased several Amazon gift cards for my grandchildren over the past few years because I dont live with them and dont know what they are into at the time and this has always worked to allow them to get what they want in time for birthdays etc It has always worked without a hitch OTHER THAN this last time when not only was my credit card charged 50 for the gift card it also showed a charge of 8591 to renew my Amazon Prime account I had previously elected to have Amazon Prime on my OLD credit card but only used it once in the entire year and felt that money could be better spent elsewhere so I did not elect to renew it

I changed my credit card and when I got your notification that my Prime account would be cancelled if I didnt provide a new one soon I elected NOT to provide you with my new credit card  I never authorized you to use my new credit card to renew my Prime account and yet you automatically charged my account for it since you linked up my previous purchases to a defunct Amazon Prime account and took it upon yourself to help yourself to my account  Yes I received a refund a couple of days later of the amount deducted but if I had committed fraud on your money the way you committed fraud on my account I would be in jail  And yet you suffer no consequences

I live on Social Security and I have to watch every dollar I spend When you deducted the 8561 from my account you left me with less than 2 in my account for food andor anything else I might need bus fare etc for those two dayssure I had enough baloney to live on so I didnt starvenor being stranded without even 225 to take the bus anywhere was a serious inconveniencebut it WAS inconvenient and it was UNACCEPTABLE

If that is the way your company wants to run its business  by helping yourself to funds in an account to which you have NOT been given permission to charge  then you are not a company I choose to do business with  Keep in mind that you are NOT the only company that offers gift cards in this manner so I have chosen to take my business elsewhere

When I found out that I was left with 2 to my name for 23 business days because of your fraud I demanded a refund and was told it would be processed quickly and I would receive a call back to confirm it  I told your rep NOT to phone back just to refund my money because I assured him that you WOULD hear from me it I didnt receive it soon  He called anywayI reminded him that I had asked him NOT to call back told him I had received the refund and hung up  Hopefully you will grasp the concept when I tell you NOT to respond to thisI have my moneyand you have lost a customer albeit a very poor one who lives on Social Security but a customer nonetheless  Please do not bother me with this nonsense again
__label__Positive	Arrived on time and in great shape no dents or damage to the metal case  Theres no appearance of any rust or corrosion like some have mentioned

__label__Positive	I was shocked at how fast it got here I ordered it coming home from work one night chose the free shipping and was shocked to receive it the very next afternoon Not much to say about the actual gift card because its just a gift card but it was cute

__label__Negative	If I had received what I ordered I would be much happier  I ordered the cupcake birthday card format but I got an ugly blue format  Not what I ordered  Plus I must have received the envelopes for the cupcake gift cards because they are too small for the ugly blue cards  Too late to return as I need them for a gift this week so I will give the card without the envelope  This is my first disappointment with Amazon

__label__Positive	It was perfect
__label__Positive	Very cute
__label__Negative	Blew away into bushes and had to look in 13 F for the envelope We have a mailbox up front and a doorstep  what kind of fool would leave an envelope in frigid temps away from the doorstep and stepping into the front yard without weighing it down

Glad I found it though Glad for the photograph but it would have helped if the envelope had been weighed down with a rock or if it had been deposited in the mailbox like most mail is delivered
__label__Positive	Ive thought gift cards as impersonal gifts However now that we have 2 grandchildren away at college I am very fond of the Amazon Gift Card This allows our grandchildren to purchase what they know they would like or have a need for It is bought and sent with love  I am definitely fond of the cards

__label__Positive	Whenever I give an Amazon gift card it is a hit It offers the recipient so many options They can shop at their own convenience and get just what they want

__label__Positive	It was perfect
__label__Positive	I loved that I could order it and send it right to the recipient  No fuss no muss

__label__Positive	Excelent
__label__Positive	Cute and soft Teddy
__label__Positive	Love Dennys and their gift cards are great and hassle free to use and they shipped out quickly
__label__Positive	It was a gift
__label__Positive	This was a gift for my niece and her family They enjoyed it very much
__label__Positive	It was nearly impossible to properly edit the photo in the amazon system I ended up editing on my computer and uploading that way And by editing I simply mean sizing Cute idea and my father loved it
__label__Positive	bien
__label__Negative	The lovely family photo I tried to upload TWICE before it showed that it had done so but it actually did not  The gift card went through with the dumb YOUR PHOTO message in the center instead of the picture
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for a what would they use situation like Fathers Day
__label__Positive	My soninlaw is a real booklover and my daughter gave him a Kindle for his birthday  Our Amazon gift voucher of 100 was VERY welcome and he hurriedly downloaded 15 books and still had money to spare  He really loves it and has convinced my husband to get a Kindle too so well soon be buying one from you Gift vouchers are a great present
__label__Positive	How could any one not give an Amazon Gift Card any less than 5s  It lets one choose any thing they want from the biggest selection available
__label__Positive	Exelent
__label__Positive	just in tome to wrap for Christmas Buffalo Wild Wings is a great place to get some good food
__label__Positive	The card was cute and very easy to print  Would do this again  very easy to work with
__label__Positive	This was a gift for my son and he loved it
__label__Positive	GREAT AND QUICK GIFT IDEA
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	great job
__label__Positive	money is always good
__label__Positive	I think the best way to give a gift they can make their own decisions for a great place like Amazon to get the wrong gift
__label__Positive	This was my first time using this project I photoshopped an image and put it as a birthday card for my brother I was concerned about the resolution of the image but he didnt have a problem seeing it
__label__Positive	Digital gift card worked perfectly
__label__Positive	I am sending it to my grandson in Missouri  I presume it will be fine
__label__Positive	This was a request by my grandson  He loves Red Robin
__label__Positive	Great product  service
__label__Positive	My Dad loves cracker barrell I get one for his Birthday
__label__Positive	great just what we were expecting thanks again
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	Im not quite sure how to review this  It did exactly what Amazon said it would do  So five stars    I guess
__label__Positive	Very fast and convenient  Recipient as thrilled
__label__Neutral	The card worked great but it was almost thrown away when it came in the mail  I had sent it as a gift but when it showed up it came in a plain white envelope with a bunch of random pages in it which made it look like random junk mail  The only reason that it was even opened was because we were expecting it to come in the mail soon  Just be sure to go through all your junk mail if you decide to order gift cards on Amazon
__label__Positive	Easy way to give a gift
__label__Positive	Perfect way to let someone know you appreciate them or to give a gift to someone you know already has everything
__label__Positive	Everyone who received a gift card from me was just as excited about this gift card holder When the top is opened it pops up the card Really cool design I gave out 4 different gift cards and each one fit perfectly into the holders These gift card holders definitely exceeded my expectations
__label__Negative	The card came dirty and the code was already half scratched off
__label__Positive	Great Idea
__label__Positive	Great Christmas Package Ordered two of them
__label__Positive	Recipient loved this gift and the packaging was very nice
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift cards are great You just enter the card data in when you are ready to purchase something and you are good to go Its perfect for anyone who doesnt know what to get someone Just get them an amazon gift card and they can get what they like I recieve them all the time and highly enjoy them You have unlimited time to spend it so when your running low on cash and your newest movie just came out on DVD just purchase it with your gift card its quite a lifesavor especially since things are less exspensive on amazon than in stores anyway
__label__Positive	Gift card worked  Super pleased
__label__Positive	It was just what my grandson wanted  He is trying to be independent and he loves shopping on Amazon  The gift card was the best idea ever
__label__Positive	Love it
__label__Negative	Just received my gift card that I bought for a gift  It is mangled and partially opened  Why  This makes me feel like the card may be compromised  Also there seems to be issues as to whether or not a receipt needs to be accompanied by gift card or if it is already activated
__label__Positive	Fast easy 
__label__Positive	Worked as expected at our local Chilis
__label__Positive	As described Card is cute
__label__Positive	This is a great way to gift your family or friends especially if they have an amazon account Faster than western union and safer than a money order Try this way of giving a gift so that way you know who is getting the gift can get exactly what they want from Amazon It takes all the guess work out of finding gifts
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	This is a very convenient and effective way to honor a recipient at a farewell party
__label__Positive	This is all my brother asks for at Christmas time  Of course he loves it
__label__Negative	I will never buy gift cards on Amazon agian if this is not resolve soon 
__label__Positive	Great time processing
__label__Positive	Arrived super fast and the box the gift card comes in is so clean
__label__Positive	thanks
__label__Positive	Enjoyed it for Mothers Day
__label__Positive	The ability to give a gift voucher and print it out in a card is worthy of 5 stars however would like more options for gift cards  This was a birthday present for a friend a girl in her 30s who is quite a tomboy and there wasnt really anything hugely suitable for the picture and message
__label__Neutral	gift card message uses fonts that does not support all characters so I get meaningless message when some czech characters was not printed out
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card was terrific
__label__Positive	I got this as a gift but it is really easy to use and great for shopping at the place with the best deals around Hahaha but seriously I love amazon I cannot shop in physical retail stores because I have an app on my phone that lets me compare prices with that store and the price on amazon and amazon wins 95 times out of 10 very rarely will a real store have a better deal than on amazon you cant go wrong with an amazon gift card D
__label__Positive	This was a gift
__label__Negative	Size description isnt accurate My sister finally tried it on as a belated birthday present and it doesnt fit quality of material is cheap too Very disappointing
__label__Positive	Sent to family overseas Went as planned no problems with delivery will do again
__label__Positive	Cant beat 1000 off
__label__Positive	Cards worked but dont expect instant delivery After a few hours I rebought the card thinking an error happened Both ended up delivering almost a full day later If youre getting this think ahead
__label__Positive	No issues just as advertised and right on time
__label__Positive	I purchased this gift card online and found the process swift and really easy The recipient found the gift card easy to use and with amazoncoms huge range of options I am sure it will be enjoyable experience
__label__Positive	Great product and fast shipping
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a gift card
__label__Positive	This place is great Make sure u get there early to see previews and order cheese fries
__label__Positive	excelent
__label__Positive	Ideal little treat to have for any ocassion
__label__Positive	This is a very convenient service nice selection of cards and easy to use  Saves time and money Thanks a lot
__label__Positive	Love luv loved them
__label__Positive	Amazon always delivers on time
__label__Positive	Helped my daughter a lot
__label__Positive	As your kids hit school youll spend most weekends going to birthday party after birthday party  I find this method so much better then shoppingguessing for each kid every weekend  Let them get what they want  I also love the personal touch option of adding a picture
__label__Positive	My daughter enjoyed opening this for
Christmas
__label__Positive	Easy peasy
__label__Positive	Thank you 
__label__Positive	Item purchased as a gift
__label__Positive	My nephews loved the Santa Tins They want to keep them The tins came sealed in plastic wrap which I liked

__label__Positive	Just perfect for everyone
__label__Positive	The purchase of the gift card was quick and easy and the delivery prompt great solution to a gift giving problem especially last minute

__label__Positive	Loved that you offered this card
__label__Positive	This was the perfect birthday gift
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for my daughter
She can purchase whatever suits her from Amazoncom Perfect online store
__label__Positive	Great quick option for a holiday gift The family enjoyed it
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a Christmas Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	It took me a little while to get started as I find the form sometimes is difficul to useappropriately It takes several tries ro get done
__label__Positive	I was skeptical to buy due to reviews But I did and the card does work I called WF directly and although they said the card doesnt show up in their system my theory was that since its bought through 3rd party amazon WF wont recognize it I say call Amazon and make sure they activate the card before you use it
__label__Positive	Got this for 45 so saved 5 on this
__label__Positive	Gift appreciated by recipient
__label__Positive	Its easy to print and fold to give as a gift Looks very nice and do t s just fine in a card Best part is I dont have to run allover town find the Amazon gift cards I recently I bed these cards before as a gift and they are easy to redeem
__label__Negative	Gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday I even called the restaurant to be sure they took egift cards Sadly  the cards could not be processed I even bought and sent him another one while he was there  thinking it was a fluke But it kept saying the card was invalid The manager really went all out  tried to convince corporate that it was legit I sent my bf a screen shot if my amazon purchase  confirmation  which was purchased just hours before he went there  wow 75 and Hooters does not refund Hoping Amazon can An odd thing cuz I use egift cards alot and never had a problem  but this was the first egift card that had no bar code Hmmm Hooters staff was great and comped his meal though
__label__Positive	Sent gift card to my nephew he loved it
__label__Positive	Great way to let your family and friends choose something they really want and will enjoy
__label__Positive	grandson loved it
__label__Positive	Bought fitbit
__label__Positive	My granddaughter liked the pretty flowers on the card but the money from Amazon was a huge hit  Thank you Amazon for making shopping easy
__label__Positive	I have used this particular video for my gift cards  It is really funny and I love it
__label__Positive	OK
__label__Positive	Convenient  and easy
__label__Positive	Loved the customization feature
__label__Positive	A convenient way of sending overseas friends something to spend  vastly cheaper than bank transfers Western Union etc Works a treat
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Very good and thanks because I received on time
__label__Positive	It is what it is
__label__Positive	This is a great way to gift a Thank You to someone friend associate family or otherwise

No Fuss No Muss And DONE
__label__Neutral	the problem is that I do not know if the person I sent this actually got this card Email version would be better
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card  Anyone can find something he or she wants
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	If youre ever not sure what to give or dont want to get personal this is the best thing to give
__label__Positive	Works great and fast I love that its all electronic now and now more waiting for it to come through the mail
__label__Positive	This was delivered quickly and made Christmas shopping that much easier  Love it
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an Amazon Gift Card
__label__Positive	I got the card  I was excited because I needed a few things that I got right away Everything I got was perfect Thank you
__label__Positive	what can you say about a gift card It was easy to purchase and send
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	The card did not work and I ended up paying full price
__label__Positive	Havent put this into practice yet but it is sound advice that makes sense
__label__Negative	I am having trouble trying to use this gift card for myself
__label__Negative	I did exactly what the directions called for to give my aunt an Amazon gift card My account shows a credit It didnt go to her card
__label__Positive	Great and Easy gift when you dont know what to buy someone Its great that this is an option Amazon has a huge selection of products for even the fussiest person A
__label__Positive	This was for my brothers 60th birthday He shops on Amazon frequently and appreciates this convenient gift very much Thanks
__label__Positive	Great and easy way to share some birthday cheer with a loved one far away
__label__Positive	Excellent  I was notified each step toward and including delivery therefore had no doubt the Gift Card was received on time
__label__Positive	Exactly as described
__label__Positive	Cannot really love a plastic card but it met my expectations just fine
__label__Positive	Good quick gift

__label__Positive	I got this egift card for my wife and it was sent to her email some 10 minutes later Great fast convenient

__label__Positive	Good gift and delivered very quickly
__label__Positive	love applebees and this made it easy for me to buy a gift certificate for a friend thanks for offering this
__label__Negative	54 for a 50 gift card  What are you drunk
__label__Positive	Do you like money but with a restriction on where you can spend it
Then an Amazon Gift Card is for you

Really though it is a better gift than money since studies show people appreciate a gift card more than money even if it restricts their choices

But also the limitations are minute as Amazon is the Everything Store If you cant find what you want here it doesnt exist

One more plus  if you have the Amazon Credit Card and you buy this you get the points So you earn a little something back from your nice gift
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	Never made it to recipient
__label__Positive	Worked fine for a quick Birthday present
__label__Positive	Great product from a great seller
__label__Positive	Loved it loved loved it bought a lot of books  I have the best son ever    
__label__Positive	What can I say  I love Amazon
__label__Positive	Awesome definitely using it every year
__label__Positive	Love the ease of purchase and the various formats in which they can be bought Having the option to customize your gift cards is also nice
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	just what I expected
__label__Positive	This works really well because my sister did not know what she wanted for her birthday
__label__Positive	It was very easy to purchase exactly what my daughterinlaw wanted for her birthday Much easier than fighting crowds at the mall
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Showed up on time and the recipient was happy
__label__Positive	I ordered the gift card one evening and received it in the mail the next day  Cute gift box  looks exactly like the photo and can be used again
__label__Neutral	It is ok for free
__label__Positive	The gift card was for my neighbors and everything was on time  They took their kids to see Sing in an AMC theater with reclining seats and had such a great time they stayed until all the credits were over and the cleaning crew cane in
Thank you
John
__label__Positive	great gift
__label__Negative	This is not a safe way to send a gift card  It was stolen likely before even arriving as the porch camera didnt show a delivery and the card was redeemed  Send an eCard much safer
__label__Positive	I could no longer find a plastic card at our local stores  Went online and there it was  This is a quick and easy way to grab a card
__label__Neutral	My nephew was very happy with the gift
__label__Positive	great

__label__Negative	Broke as soon as I opened it to put in the gift card
__label__Positive	Easy to print and an instant gift  Thanks
__label__Positive	Great way to allow them to get what THEY WANT  You can add photos of special moments or whatever and it prints and folds just like a greeting card remember to put your printer in ALandscape mode before printing  All you need is an appropriate size envelope
__label__Positive	Loved them So did my grandkids
__label__Positive	Worked as it should
__label__Neutral	Had to do it twice to get the gift card to go
__label__Positive	I needed to get a gift card for someone but was unable to leave the house so I ordered this Its very nice
__label__Positive	I like to use Amazon eGift Card as my gift to my friends in different occasions  It safes my time and energy in shopping around for the gift that fits everyone  I hope Amazon can offer more Animated Cards for us to choose
__label__Positive	Everything was as promised
__label__Positive	Clear picture of flowers but they would look better if there had been leaves augmenting them
__label__Positive	Had been given Visa gift cards which Amazon does not accept unless you can put the entire purchase on it However it was super easy and fast to simply purchase Amazon Gift cards with the Visa ones and then make all of my purchases leaving me to  pay what was left over
__label__Positive	Nice little gift box for someone special
__label__Positive	Bought it as a gift The recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Does what its supposed to duh

__label__Positive	adorable they loved it
__label__Negative	Excellent gift
__label__Positive	Just what i needed
__label__Positive	Super way to send a last minute birthday wish
__label__Positive	Great Purchase Amazon emailed right away within minutes
__label__Negative	I didnt like that when you add the gift card Its a pre set amount Guests should be able to dictate the amount of a gift card
__label__Positive	The gift card was a great purchase I just didnt know what to get someone who just retired and had
Everything he could want but really did not need anything It was great he could get it the same day and shop for something he could
Use

Thank you Amazon
__label__Positive	I love the simple way to order this gift card Its ideal if you need to get it there fast and your recipient is an avid reader Be careful to check the amount youre buying the gift card for because it has 100 as a default setting
__label__Positive	Its money of course they love it
__label__Positive	Easy and fast to use
__label__Positive	An easy way that Amazon lets you set up a personalized gift card with your own photo and message Thanks Amazon  My friend appreciated the gift
__label__Positive	Convenience
__label__Positive	Great gifts
__label__Negative	Ordered on March 19 for a birthday present When I last spoke with the person  ealy April they had not received it
__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift card It gets there quickly with free shipping and I love the box it comes in
__label__Positive	Great way to pay for your purchases at Panera

Excellent
__label__Positive	As described
__label__Positive	great item
__label__Neutral	I found it difficult to find how to purchase a gift card and then it took a while to work out how to load it onto my account this process should be very simple since you cant bulk buy kindle books and with currency charges etc it makes sense to purchase a gift card
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Everything went smoothly with this purchase
__label__Neutral	Okay
__label__Neutral	GREAT
__label__Positive	quick service
__label__Positive	Its a GC nothing more to say

__label__Negative	I dont know what this is
I did receive a 25 gift certificate in January from Barbara Widtfeldt but there was nothing about uploading a photo

__label__Negative	My daughters family sent me a 10000 Landrys Multibrand Gift Card She knows I like Mastros Steak House and she told me to use it at Mastros The Quick Gift envelope the gift card came in said 100 Mastros Thousand Oaks CA In January I dined at Mastros When the bill came I gave the waiter my Amex Card and the Landrys Multibrand gift card When the waiter returned he said Landrys hasnt put us on their gift card system yet so I put the whole amount on your Amex Card I asked to speak to the manager The manager confirmed what the waiter told me Then asked to see the gift card I gave it to him and he wnt to a phone and checked the balance When he came back he said the card had a zero balance When I got home I called the balance checking number and discovered the card still has a 10000 balance i wrote a letter of complaint to Landrys corporate office and followed up with two telephone calls Landrys never called me back Yesterday I called two nearby Mortons Steakhouses to see if I could use my gift card at Mortons In both cases the person on the other end of the phone told me I could not use the gift card at Mortons because Landrys hasnt put us on their gift card system yet
__label__Negative	Purchased this card December 18th and went to redeem it in store at Forever 21 today and the card had no balance on it Cashier at the store and customer service said the card was never activated Very disappointed

__label__Positive	My husband reads on  our kindle all the time  The gift card was one of the best thing he received for Christmas
__label__Positive	Product as described arrived promptly
__label__Negative	Very disappointed that the gift card arrived wrapped in a plastic bag sans any indication of its denomination or activation and sans the identifying hangingtag card in the ad How am I supposed to give this as a gift

I expect Ill either buy a little giftcard carrier which I shouldnt have to or mosey on down to my local Peets and ask one of the nice clerks there for a proper giftcard envelopealso something I should not have to do
__label__Negative	I opted to have a note sent along with this gift card to my brother  However when he recd it there was NO indication of WHO it was from nor was the optional typed note I included via Amazons online ordering  He said he thought it was a promotional credit he may have won from an online survey  Nice  Not

__label__Positive	My gift recipient quickly and easily purchased some needed items for her home with her amazon gift card and was wellpleased both with the ease of shopping and with the products that she received
__label__Positive	When youre a poor college student with extra Amazon gift cards and dont know what to spend them on a logical choice is buying yourself enough Dominos gift cards to provide pizza to meet all your needs for the entirety of finals week

Im serious though Thats what I did last finals week and its pretty great Didnt have to worry about wasting time from studying to cook had pizza anytime I wanted and for any meal and I handed out pizza to hungry friends in my study groups I may not have gotten an A on all my finals but this plan sure gets an A from me

__label__Positive	Good

__label__Positive	This boxcard combo was a perfect gift for my brother I really like the design and thought it masculine and not frillygirly My brother however upon opening his gift expressed his excitement and immediately put the card in his wallet and trashed the tin Next time Ill save myself the trouble and Amazon the expense of shipping and just get him an emaildelivered gift card
__label__Positive	Recipient loved it Easy to redeem online
I think having to use so many words is absolutely maddening and unnecessary
__label__Negative	I was getting ready to order gift csrds thankfully I read the reviews first WILL NOT BE BUYING GIFT CARDS FROM AMAZON  THANKS FOR YOUR INPUT PEOPLE

__label__Positive	It was sent as s gift

__label__Positive	Nice way to buy a last minute present
__label__Positive	Amazon gift card sent to my nephew for his birthday
__label__Positive	Hard to mess up a gift card
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Negative	Amazon gift cards should be the perfect no hassle Christmas gift  However for two years in a row now the gift messages that I include with my gift card purchases have not been included  in fact the receiver had no idea who sent the card unless I mentioned it to them  This is really not acceptable for a company the size of Amazon  Next year I will probably have to go with gift cards from a competitor
__label__Positive	the best way to buy on Amazon I love it so much thanks for create this card am gonna use more
__label__Positive	Very cute And its already wrapped I just added a gift tag and put it over the bar code
__label__Negative	Bought 2 cards as gifts One worked the other said there was no credit on it when my niece tried to use it Amazon will not help me

__label__Positive	my niece loved this happy little card
__label__Positive	A gift card is exactly what my son wanted Just as good as cash and he was able to buy what he wanted
__label__Positive	Made my mom smile Great options to send an ecard
__label__Neutral	I wanted to purchase a AU50 gift card try as I may the gift card kept reverting back to US dollars at different steps during the transaction so I ended up having to pay AU5648 which I was seriously not happy with
__label__Positive	Excellent deal for gift card Quick service on shipment We like Ruby Tuesdays for the salad bar The salad bar is loaded with lots of fresh options The burgers are outstanding as well
__label__Positive	Everyone in my family who expects gifts from me and has a computer loves getting a gift card in their email box from amazon  Are you kidding  How easy can it be now to buy for my brother and his wife  And my daughter a constant reader like me begs for an ecard when shes out of reading material and doesnt know what to read right then  Folks do try this amazon makes it so simple to do  And the card can arrive in the email right now
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Beautiful gift tin
__label__Positive	maravilloso
__label__Negative	Buyers be aware
Gift card may not be accepted by noncorporate owned shops
I understand if a franchise store does not participate any reward or promotion program
However refusing to honor coporate issued gift card is a dishonest and a basically a scam
All shops near me are basically franchised shops and make the card totally useless
So if you ever think about giving this gift card to a friend please double think and save them from the trouble and un pleasure experience
I was forced to pay by credit card after my haircut I would appreciate at least they hang a sign indicating gift cards are not accepted
__label__Positive	Perfect for any Princess Adorable packaging
__label__Positive	Work as it is supposed
__label__Positive	Quickly received no surprises
__label__Positive	Great gift for anyone
__label__Positive	Perfect birthday surprise Packaged well and tin can be used in the future
__label__Positive	Its just what I expected having used a friends  older version Its perfect easy to use keep clean allows for crisp  clean  dry salad greens No more bagged salads for me
__label__Positive	Gift Cards are just the best gift anyone can give or receive It is so much easier to let a person choose and purchase what they would really like Dont get me wrong I love shopping buying and wrapping gifts But far more enjoy letting the receiver choose for themselves It is especially helpful when the person you are giving to is not where a gift can be hand delivered

Amazon Gift Cards are delivered on time and the animated ones are the best
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	I ordered 4 gift cards  theyre nice but there are 2 boxes that are not clean
__label__Positive	My entire family enjoys gifting restaurant cards  Applebees is all over the country and perhaps the most prolific chain in all regions  the West the South the Midwest and the Midatlantic regions where I do most of my travels The restaurant is in every state except in Hawaii  Even Anchorage AK has one Theres usually a restaurant in every college town because this chain likes to hire college students as servers

These sell out fast when Amazon offers these as Lightning deals because these are so popular  The restaurants menu appeals to all ages from traveling single person to large families or retired folks The card can be redeemed at any Applebees theres never an issue with counterfeit cards sold through Amazon and the cards work for the entire bill  These are ideal to gift for birthdays anniversaries or just because

Go to Applebees official website for all its locations
__label__Positive	LOVE the package presentation box  Its the only form of gift card packaging that I buy now
__label__Positive	This was a perfect gift I the little container was super cute

__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Good gift for my Grandson
__label__Positive	I love this presentation for a gift Much nicer that what you buy at a local store And the shipping was fast and free
__label__Positive	Its a gift card  It works  Enough said

__label__Positive	Im sure it is hard to find such a dynamic company like Amazon online today With their host of products ranging from toaster ovens and recipe books to affordable audio and video cables and adult themed goodies Im pretty positive they have what you ever so desire at any given time

Giving the gift of Amazon is my thing and how I work it Ask any number of my friends and theyll tell you I am and Amazon freak So what does an Amazon fanboy give out as Birthday Christmas and Wedding giftswell Amazon gift cards of course

__label__Positive	You should have seen my Grandson eyes when he seen he could go to Toco Bell and get exactly what he wanted or taken his Dad out to eat He loved it
__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift card
__label__Positive	This is a great way to give a gift  The ordering was easy and the recipient got the email right on time  And even though hes not tech savvy he said it was easy to add the certificate to his Amazon account  No need to keep track of a card  Its perfect

__label__Positive	Convenient to have availability to purchase
__label__Negative	WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
__label__Negative	did not work had to return go through refund process and now the birthday has passed so late gift embarrassing
__label__Positive	It suits its purpose  Hey Amazon could you guys make more varieties and rotate the ones you have  Ive had to use two of the same ones to send out to the same people because there arent newer ones to choose from  I like the option of sending out egift cards
__label__Positive	worked great
__label__Positive	Gift cards make easy gifts Easy to order receive and then give away  I liked the picture on the card as it fit in with the holiday
__label__Positive	Good way to reward somebody
__label__Neutral	its a gift card
__label__Positive	They deliver within minutes and very easy to use
__label__Negative	I purchased this because I was offered a 15 dollar separate gift card with purchase of a 50 dollar one When I put promo code in at checkout it stated promo has been applied However I have not received anything about the 15 gift card The offer and code were both shown within the Amazon app so I know it wasnt a 3rd party scam Very upsetting and annoying
__label__Positive	clever design  no surprises classic amazon
__label__Positive	I bought this for my nieces wedding We put ribbons on it and had it on the present table Perfect for all the cards so they dont get lost
__label__Positive	when you know someone who buys from Amazon often a gift card for a special occasion is a great idea and takes only seconds to transmit
__label__Negative	Whoever sold this gift card is a scam artist the person I gifted it too tried to use it today and it says it was used completely on December 19th
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Negative	Cant use it on Australian Amazon to purchase Kindle books 
That was the purpose of buying the gift card in the first place
__label__Positive	Nice packaging  I didnt feel like I needed to wrap further
__label__Positive	Awesome Xmas Gifts
__label__Positive	Lovely presentationwell done
__label__Positive	One note as the card says you need to use the card  a steak and shake before you can call to see a balance

__label__Positive	my kids have Kindles and I usually get them hardback books for gifts  This gift card was easy On the confirmation from Amazon in my email it said I could print it from my order site which I did  If I did not see that I would probably still be waiting for my in 15 min email

__label__Positive	Very pleased  Understated little box with quality ribbon  Was perfect wedding gift and easy to send
__label__Positive	I love the Amazon Gift Cards So much easier to send then other email gift cards and also the money you put on them goes a lot farther than sending a WalMart eGift Card or Sears eGift Card

Amazons prices are cheaper especially if the receiver has Prime membership and you can get a lot more bang for your buck when you purchase from Amazon

__label__Positive	It was the first time ever doing a gift card long distance  it was so easy Ill certainly do it again Thank you
__label__Positive	I like how it is an actual card as well rather than a print at home version

__label__Positive	Its a gift card for Southwest  If you travel to a place where Southwest flies then whats not to love  Value doesnt expire so you can forget about it in a drawer for a while and then surprise yourself when you find the money you forgot about  If you dont love it and dont want to use it for yourself then gift it to someone  I will be sure to write a thank you note to anyone who wants to gift one to me  The card has a nice plastic feel to it and has a lovely Southwest logo so its recipient knows where they can use it

__label__Positive	Love that gift card is processed immediately and shows up in email within a few minutes
Will definitely keep buying ecards on AmazonTY 
__label__Negative	So everybody loves Amazon gift cards hence you are reading this review

If you are like me you wanted something a little nicer than the simple gift card and much nicer than the printed email so you looked at getting the gift card with a free box

Well although our gift card arrived in a padded envelope the box was dented and somewhat mushed not quite in giftable condition

As this was a thank you gift for our kids swim instructor she was most interested in the actual gift card it was a little bit disappointing to me to feel the need to put the gift card in a dented box and then hide the dented box in a gift bag

Next time Ill stick with the simple gift card only route
__label__Positive	Always a good idea for a gift Now days everyone has everything so with a gift card they can select something they need
__label__Positive	Perfect  The gift box was very stylish
__label__Positive	Sent this giftcard to my boss for his birthday and he loved it I didnt have time to run to the store to get him something so this egiftcard was perfect because I sent it to his email
__label__Positive	You cant get it wrong with an Amazon gift card  It is the perfect gift for the person who has everything
__label__Positive	Especially when youre flying out of town for a weddingno bulky gifts to haul with you  And what couple wouldnt love to curl up together with some great tv shows movies and books
__label__Positive	Cute gift card selection
__label__Positive	My daughterinlaws baby shower invites had a Giraffeskin print to them and so once our precious little girl was born I have bought her stuffed giraffes and other such items  The picture on this card symbolized for me my Grandma love for my little Baby love
__label__Positive	Easy gift to send overseas for our son in the Army  He can order books for his Kindle we gave him last Christmas
__label__Negative	Being able to send these at the last minute is great
I just can not believe that the choices of cards are so horribly limited and ugly I am embarrassed to send them I absolutely hate them
__label__Positive	Made my grown kids very happy
__label__Positive	Its a gift card  not much to say other than the good news that ordering it went smoothly and it arrived very quickly

I thought the card came out beautifully and so did she

__label__Positive	It was a wonderful gift and made my sister in law very happy
__label__Positive	the Amazon gift card provided an opportunity for the recipient to select the gift he wanted and thus save me the inconvenience of returns and exchanges
__label__Negative	A very simple idea how could they go wrong  I set one of these up for a Christmas present and Amazon cancelled it  All because my credit card expires in December  The old expiration date WAS STILL GOOD but no the new card had been issued so they said there was an issue with the card and cancelled the order  And this is Amazons own rewards card on an account that is paid up in full  the only issue was it expired this month
__label__Positive	I ordered this gift card and had it shipped to family out of state  It was delivered promptly and was super convenient
__label__Positive	Just what I needed
__label__Positive	This product was ordered on the 18th and was received on the 23rd even though it was supposed to be two day shipping Im very glad that I ordered them so early because they are Christmas gifts and that could have caused an issue for me That maybe something that Amazon may want to take into consideration I also was unsatisfied with the tins the gift cards came in They appear to be just normal gift card tins but they have a window in them that shows that its a gift card I just found that a bit tacky and thought the gift tine would look better without it I xan deal with that but nothing was said about it in the description Still it does the job but taking off a star for delivery and product description Just a lil disapointed in amazon
__label__Positive	This is an easy way to give gifts and they  can always find what they want through Amazon be it kindle books or products
__label__Positive	Whats not to like about a gift card
__label__Positive	I LOVE Einstein And Amazon makes it easy

got it for my birthday and love it
i have everything i want so it was a perfect gift
__label__Positive	I would have given it 5 stars but it does not have a lifetime warranty like Xikar products Extremely sharp blades eay to use looks great You might want to but a drop of oil from time to time on the closing action it tends to stick in the humid Jersey weather
__label__Positive	Convenientwhats not to like
__label__Positive	D
__label__Positive	Ideal way to send gift certificate overseas notified of delivery hassle free Used it before and no doubt will do so again

__label__Positive	Wonderful  Thanks 
__label__Positive	I have two teenage nephews and I never know what to get them  Since Amazon carries everything an Amazon gift card is perfect  Being able to send the gift card by email is a big plus  If I forget a birthday or special event my gift can get there right on time  Makes everyones life a lot easier
__label__Positive	worked out well
__label__Positive	Their Webpage was broken it would not let me purchase two 50 certificates for two different people but same household The web page was confusing and difficult to navigate instructions were not clear  when I clicked on the icon that showed demarcations of 25100 available it kept reverting back to allow only a 25 certificate In the end I could not send two 50 certificates one to each of two brothers who graduated I had to send purchase FOUR 25 certificates Kind of embarrassing
__label__Positive	They have good food  Most the food was good I got but a portion of it that tasted dried out like it was under a lamp for a couple

__label__Positive	Very cute way to give an appreciated gift to the nieces and nephews
__label__Positive	I didnt notice until recently that the gift cards can been credited to the account right away You dont need to wait for a purchase This is great for emailed cards so that it is not lost later
__label__Positive	There is really nothing wrong with this gift card and the card it comes with Its actually quite nice that Amazon will give you a free card to include the gift card in However I gave them only four stars based on the fact that my guaranteed delivery date was missed and my gift card was nowhere to be found to give as a Christmas present

__label__Positive	Ive never really been one to send gift cards Mostly because it always seemed kinda lazy like something youd do when you dont care enough to shop However last year I waited a bit late so I sent my mom a gift card for her birthday She confided to me later that she really loved it because it gave her money that dad didnt know about that she could spend on whatever she might want Gifts for grandkids or just something personal she wanted for herself So this year I sent her another gift card knowing it was something she really enjoyed

__label__Positive	made a great gift
__label__Positive	cute box
__label__Positive	The gift card is attached inside the greeting card  However there are instructions for the gift card printed on the back of the greeting card  So you cannot use the greeting card separate from the gift card as I was planning to do

__label__Neutral	I ordered the 15 gift card bundle attached to holiday cards When I received the cards there were no envelopes with them I called amazon to explain they forgot the envelops I had ordered the holiday gift cards in the past and had no problems and the item is shown with envelops When I spoke to the operator she was very kind and put me on hold to get some advice on this oversight When she returned she explaind that she was told the gift cards no longer came with envelopes Why would I order gift holiday cards without envelopes She then gave me a small credit and directed me to a link to ORDER and pay for blank envelopes This was a week before Christmas I was annoyed but I needed the envelopes so I did place the order Long story short three days later I received a whole new order of gift cards with envelopes and the other gifts I had ordered through amazon So I called again there was a glitch and all of my orders were doubled And in the second order the envelopes were included It turns out giftcard attached to holiday cards do come with envelopes So she was kind but misinformed and now I have a box of envelopes I will never use and had to go to UPS to return all of the doubled items And hope that when I am credited  because of course I was charged twice the monies that this will not have voided the cards that I did give out to my nieces and nephews

__label__Positive	This is a perfectly good gift card for Fandango

First you need to understand that Fandango is for convenience with movie ticket buying online It works with a multitude of theatre brands but not all of them Naturally there is a CONVENIENCE fee because Fandango has to make money on top of the box office prices The purpose of Fandango is convenience and you pay for convenience simple as that
Second Fandango is not available at every brand of theatre If you havent used Fandango before check the website before purchasing a Fandango card
Third If you dont want to pay for a convenience fee please buy another gift card directly to the theatre brand itself and stop leaving 1 star reviews on a perfectly good Fandango gift card

My only complaint with this is that there is no 15 denomination If they had that option I would give it 5 stars 15 is an average price for 1 movie ticket including the conv fee
__label__Positive	Great egift cards to print and give out as gifts  Lots of cards to choose from online and very easy to use Amazon website I would highly recommend
__label__Negative	If a birthday card was sent then Amazon stinks I ordered a basic gift card

__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	loved it
__label__Positive	During the holidays I purchased gifts as normal but one night someone came over that wasnt expected and I was fairly sure they were going to give me a gift As I didnt have time to run out to a store to get a physical gift card I jumped on amazon put some money on this printed it out like 10 minutes later and stuck it in a Christmas card Interestingly enough the gift the person gave me was equivalent to the amount on this card In a pinch this works like a charm as would say egift cards from popular chains like Starbucks which you can mail from their respective apps these days
__label__Neutral	very cute card I just wish Amazon had some better word choices for the inside of the cards
__label__Positive	It was a convenient way to send a gift without delay I tried to text it to my recipient but it did not go through so I opted to email it which was delivered immediately

__label__Positive	Received this in a few minutes
__label__Positive	These make the perfect gift for friends and family at any holiday time of the year Keep them on hand
__label__Positive	Perfect gift

 This allowed my daughter  who is IMPOSSIBLE to know what she wantsneeds as most 18ers are
The gift card gave her the opportunity to buy what she wanted what she really wanted  which is its purpose but it arrived on her birthday and with the picture added  it really touched her

Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Fast shipping to email  Cant go wrong with Amazon gift cards  A
__label__Positive	My fantastic go to gift when I forget an occasion or need a fast thank you Has saved me loads of time and frustration

__label__Positive	Always a good gift
__label__Positive	Much need option to send to someone
__label__Positive	Fast and easy cant beat it for a last minute gift
__label__Neutral	I dont know if it was the packaging or who put the card box together but it was all bent out of shape The part that was supposed to pop out didnt pop out because it was tucked into the slot where the gift card was I spent time trying to fold it into place but it didnt work Sad and disappointed that it doesnt look nice It came in a sealed bag so I assumed that it is fine As I was finally ready to wrap it up into a box I decided to check it and found that it was bent in all the wrong places
__label__Positive	Recipients were pleased
__label__Positive	Very cute gift card small gift holders You just have to be careful when placing the cards inside a couple of them They were sturdier than I expected The velcro patches used to close the flaps were strong enough on their own but I chose to add tape because I was transporting the gifts
__label__Positive	Added no problem
__label__Positive	I love giving these gift cardsso easy and useful for almost anyone or occasion  Ive given several and plan to continue
__label__Positive	I bought this for my Dad for Christmas He loves it My son has one too and I think I use it more than he does
__label__Positive	whats not to love its amazon cash
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	Shipping is free and fast I know that a digital gift card is available but its a little nicer to send something physical Plus people seem to be happier getting something in the mail thats not a utility bill
__label__Positive	I have ordered the gift cards before but this time I was confused at first and needed to start the order over  But made it through the process in a short time  Also I like being notified when the card has been delivered
__label__Positive	Yes its just a gift card but the presentation of the card in a nice gift box at no extra cost makes it a much nicer gift I do wish it did not have the window in the bottom of the box because that makes it easy to see what the gift is
__label__Positive	worked out
__label__Positive	Easy to use for those times when you cant think what to get and to make sure something arrives on time  My daughter picked out what she said was needed and was very pleased  I will to a card again in the future as it worked out great for  both of us
__label__Positive	Buy this because everyone loves Starbucks
__label__Negative	Not labeled with gift card amount  I bought multiple denominations and need to know how much is on each card before giving to people  I spent 23 minutes with customer rep trying to figure it out  She promised to send email with serial number and matching value  Never got it  I will be returning all my gift cards and purchase elsewhere
__label__Positive	My daughters birthday gift
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love a gift card  This was so easy to purchase online and print all in the same 5 minutes  Thanks for such a great service
__label__Negative	Got a nice discount on this card but unfortunately the seller doesnt seem to be activating them correctly The first card I received didnt work at the restaurant so I had to pay differently ugh The second card I checked ahead of time and I found from chatting with Applebees CS that it wasnt activated properly before being sent to us so it also doesnt work

This is unfortunate at this point Im not able to get a working card to actually use it Not sure why the seller ACI Gift Cards Inc doesnt validate that the cards actually work before sending them
__label__Positive	I dont know how you could go wrong with a gift card I got it as a gift for my aunt and she loved it  Allows her to buy whichever book she wanted for her kindle
__label__Positive	Thank u
__label__Positive	Wow I wish Iwas the lucky person I gave this to
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for my son in law Quick easy and loved by everyone
__label__Neutral	I purchase Amazon Gift cards every year during Christmas and they always arrive promptly and attractively packaged  This year however something happened and I received two boxes of gift cards on the same day duplicate orders  I assumed that there was a processing glitch at Amazon and that only one of the orders of cards was valid  I received no communication from Amazon conveying which order was the good order and couldnt determine which was the good order without activating the cards myself and this wouldnt work as they arent transferable after activation  So I took a chance and gave out a set from one of the boxes and held onto the other set just in case  As my luck would have it when my nephews and nieces tried to use the cards they didnt work  The gift cards I gave out were the invalid ones  Fortunately my nephews and nieces are good kids and they knew I would make it right  So through the help of my sisterinlaw and a lot of time texting we got the good card information to the kids  Even though it all worked out in the wash Amazon certainly could have made it a lot easier with one little email  Ill definitely have to reassess my gift card purchases next year
__label__Negative	This ecard was a gift that didnt arrive on the day it was scheduled to I had to contact someone to have it sent again
__label__Positive	I like panda express and I got panda express with this

__label__Positive	This was a gift for my granddaughter and she is a starbucks fan  She loves her coffee and loved this gift
__label__Positive	My friend was able to discover true satisfaction from my gift
__label__Positive	Easy instructions on how to print and get
__label__Positive	Came very quickly and was in a nice presentation box  Will order again
__label__Positive	nice birthday tag attached
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card is the right answer for a last minute outottown birthday present  The recipient was thrilled and shopping online within minutes
__label__Positive	I think its a super idea to be able to download your own picturethe recipient loved it  Photo quality was not great  but good enough  Thanks
__label__Positive	convenient gift

__label__Positive	I love these cards You can set the amount given and the number of cards to gift You have choices of the occasions to tailor the card so it folds into a presentable package when printed They are a terrific way to gift someone the freedomtochose their own items I used this vehicle at Christmas to gift our Marine detatchment and express my support and gratitude for their service It is a perfect way to give your gift of freedomofchoice

__label__Positive	Got it for a friends birthday  They love IHOP and treated themselves with us around
__label__Positive	I love ordering gift cards without having to leave my house
__label__Positive	Great for grandkids
__label__Positive	Easy to send and accessed by the recipient I send Amazon Gift cards often
__label__Positive	LOVE the cute minisize Amazon box that the gift card comes in
__label__Positive	Mom loved it
__label__Positive	I enjoy giving Amazon gift cards to people They are easy to order and people love to receive them Thanks
__label__Positive	Amazon gift card is always a great gift
__label__Positive	My daughter loved the tin idea
__label__Positive	When it comes to email gift cards Amazon gets it right
__label__Positive	Cute little gift box
__label__Positive	WAS GIVEN AS A HOLIDAY GIFT
__label__Positive	Loved That I could put the gift card on Facebook You never know when people are going to check their emails so this was a great way to transmit a present
__label__Neutral	Food was okay
__label__Negative	Im sure this does not happen all of the time but the card ended up not working and I had to call and have amazon manually add it to my friends account along with another one In the end Amazon was very helpful and did not give me a hard time I am pleased with the customer service just wish it worked the first time so my friend did not have to wait to use there gift
__label__Positive	I loved the option of putting a personal photo on the front of the gift card and my sister loved receiving it
__label__Positive	First time buying a gift card on Amazon  Very easy transaction
__label__Positive	fast no problems convenient and no time limits Whats not to like I have used the amazon gift card several times to convert other prizes into amazon purchasing power Since they carry just about everything its like money in the bank I have never had any issues and am completely happy with the card For yourself or as a gift to others Perfect
__label__Positive	Love gift cards however I was supposed to receive a 10 addition to my account after I bought a 50 card but I have yet to see it
__label__Negative	If youre not familiar with the cost of Sunglass Hut then look up the cost on their website before buying this gift card The average cost is around 200 so your 50 gift card is not much of a gift They will not let you return the card after 30 days If youre going to buy it then buy it as late as possible
__label__Positive	So quick and easycan generate a gift on demand
__label__Positive	Used for gifts for great nieces and great nephews The loved the chance to shop on their own
__label__Positive	excellent
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	The recipient never received and I was not able to find how to get a refund Not sure Ill give this card again Ill eat the fees and go Visa gift card next time
__label__Negative	My friend I sent it to said it didnt work guess I should of read other reviews saying the codes dont freaking work 25 dollars wasted
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	I was very happy as was the birthday girl who got it Thank you
__label__Positive	very easy process
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	Bought this as a Lightning Deal at a discount which made having dinner at BJs a lessexpensive evening
__label__Positive	Great Gift for Christmas  Can certainly apply it towards purchase of a book Ive wanted to read  Thanks a lot
__label__Positive	who wouldnt love it
__label__Positive	arrived as stated  on time  thanks
__label__Positive	Everyone loves gift cards
__label__Positive	I needed one more Christmas gift  and I was able to order these before the holidays

I got the gift card in a few days  and was the perfect Christmas gift
__label__Positive	Sent this to my sister via email and she loved it I had to return to Amazon a defective dash cam I got her for Christmas and so this was my way of getting her some money to buy a different dash cam fast She bought her gift and shes happy which made me happy
__label__Negative	When I ordered this popup the card pictured also had a Happy Birthday theme The one that arrived was what is now pictured a black A with smile Also gift card barely pops out maybe 12 inch Oh well the money on it is still good
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Positive	The package was almost more of a hit than the gift card  They loved it
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	It only makes sense that the best gift would be the one the person gets to choose  Adding a photo made the gift better than just sending money
__label__Positive	Grandson loved it
__label__Positive	This was a great gift for a friend of mine that is an avid Amazon Shopper He really liked it and appreciated how easy it was to use
__label__Positive	it went over very well thank you
__label__Positive	Cute box can be reused with other cards to fit any theme
__label__Positive	Christmas gifts
__label__Positive	As other reviewers have mentioned the product itself is lovely and delivery is fast However the cards come in snowflake tins that are SEALED and there is NO indication of denomination anywhere  Thus one would either have to a unwrap the gift card to determine its value or b call Amazon and seek assistance  After 20 minutes on the phone I was finally able to locate an Amazon employee who had me read each  of SEVEN card serial number to her so she could look up the value of each card Come on AmazonIm not the first one to complain about this  I love you guys but this is sloppy
__label__Positive	1010 would buy again
__label__Positive	Son in law was very happy with his gift card  He enjoys using them
__label__Positive	cute
__label__Positive	Gift cards are a perfect gift for anyone What better gift card to give than an Amazon card The things you can choose from to purchase are endless and the prices are great
__label__Positive	Gift and attractive greeting card arrived promptly and my friend was thrilled with it because she loves Amazon
__label__Positive	It keep nicely wrapped in the free box Satisfied
__label__Positive	I needed to send a wedding gift to the daughter of some friends overseas and this was the perfect way for them to get something that they really want
__label__Positive	Nice Item
__label__Positive	Works great and recipient buys what the want
__label__Positive	My wife loved the heart made of flowers It looks pretty good when printed in blackandwhite too

And of course you can never go wrong with the gift of money
__label__Positive	Good Breads Good pastries and a lot more to enjoy I find when I get these I check the balance immediately as mistakes can be made and you dont find out until you go to shop with the card that there is nothing on it Good to always check the balance and if you give it as a gift make sure you tell the person to check the balance Otherwise love these gift cards so much easier than just giving money what better than to give someone a gift of a place they enjoy to eat at or shop at
__label__Positive	
__label__Positive	my niece loved her cardthank you Amazon

__label__Positive	Always an easy and very welcomed gift to give someone who purchases from Amazon  Comes in handy and brings a smile
__label__Positive	Good product Was a nice gift to a friend
__label__Positive	Gift cards are the best overall gifts and this process took me less than 5 minutes at Amazon I also liked the ability to print off a card and not simply only have an email sent to the gift receiver because I was able to give the gift card in person on this occasion However I do like the email option too for those times when I am unable to give gift in person Process was super quick and simple and I will continue to utilize this service from Amazon
__label__Positive	a gift
__label__Negative	Horrible experience with MyHabit Will never order from that website again

__label__Positive	Easy way to gift
__label__Positive	Wow fast delivery
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with a Steak n Shake gift card  I was so happy to get the lightning deal saving 5 and the gift recipient was happy to be able to buy some delicious burgers and fries at his neighborhood restaurant
__label__Positive	I ordered a holiday style card with a personalized message  It took almost 2 wks to receive but I figured it was bc the personalization  When they arrived too late to exchange they were the stock card I wonder who got my clever message Yes my sons appreciated them the same and they spend just the same for the thing theyve always wanted I was just a little disappointed they didnt experience the thought I put behind a plain ol gift card
__label__Positive	Awesme
__label__Positive	Exactly what I wanted they fulfilled the order in time for Christmas which made it perfect
__label__Negative	I purchased as a Christmas gift Today the gift recipient said the card was empty when he tried to use it I purchased the card from Amazon assuming it would be safer than purchasing in store Really disappointed
__label__Positive	Loved it I didnt have to leave the house And the people I gave them to really enjoy them
__label__Positive	good item
__label__Positive	So easy to email a gift card Recipient very happy Will do this again Fun designs to pick from from
__label__Positive	Gift cards make perfect gifts for the hard  to shop for person on your list
__label__Positive	Not much to say about this since its a gift card but Ill assure you that it works  Great place
__label__Positive	didnt have to travel 30 minutes to purchase
__label__Positive	Wonderful product at a discounted price Who wouldnt love using them
__label__Positive	Worked great

__label__Positive	YES
__label__Positive	Great decorative and handy gift cards  easy to use at any starbucks  Amazon offered fast shipping too  Will buy again thanks
__label__Negative	I got this 50 gift card for my brother  I sent it to him  He tried to use it at Olive Garden  The restaurant told him that there was insufficient funds on the card for a 40 meal  He went ahead and paid cash for his meal  Then he called me and let me know what happened  I contacted AMAZON and the girl that responded to my query told me that you cant use email delivery cards at the restaurant  you can only use them ON LINE  I said thats not what it said when I purchased the ecard  She said Im sorry maam the only thing I can do for you is offer you a refund  So I said please DO refund me for the purchase of this card  So AMAZON gave me a refund  I turned around and went to GiftCertificatescom and ordered the exact same ecard  I sent it to my brother and he was able to use it without issue  Theres either something wrong with AMAZON gift cards OR AMAZON Customer Support  or there is something wrong at the Olive Garden that my brother went to  I kinda think its AMAZON customer support
__label__Positive	Fast service A
__label__Positive	The person I sent it to really appreciated it  He is an avid reader so it couldnt be a more perfect gift
__label__Positive	Good deal
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Positive	got it for my college kid  she very much appreciated it
__label__Positive	perfect gift for a teenager
__label__Positive	Simple and quick
__label__Positive	Since I wasnt going to be able to be with my son on his birthday I chose an Amazon gift card to be sent electronically  There are so many products available from this website that I knew he would be able to find something that he liked  I didnt have to worry about getting a gift card and trying to send it through the mail wondering if it would get to him in time

I like the idea of an online Amazon gift card  The reason I only gave it four stars is because it doesnt have quite the personal touch of being able to hand the gift to the birthday recipient yourself  I received a thankyou note sent through Amazon so I knew immediately that he received and appreciated the gift
__label__Positive	Pretty cool packaging
__label__Positive	good stuff
__label__Positive	I especially like the box this gift card came in The gift is for a man and the box was perfect As always I feel you cant go wrong with a Amazoncom gift card

__label__Positive	This was an easy option for giving to go along with a Kindle for my mother for Christmas The instructions were easy to follow and the whole process was easy for myself who is a first time user and not overly technically savvy and the end product was as promisedI would happily do similar again and recommend others to do it to

__label__Positive	This was a wonderful way to send Christmas cheer to my sons family overseas
__label__Negative	Here is my experience I have several eGift cards that I have purchased during their promotion a couple of months ago I printed one of my 100 eGift cards I carry it with me I was using it for a month now in my panera store it was working Now my balance is half way through it and suddenly since Friday of last week Feb 5th it stopped working in store When they run it through it shows denied and the cashier is saying that it shows on their monitor that it is frozen I come there every day and I was there the day before on Feb 4th and paid with my eGiftCard and I had a receipt with me to prove it and on that receipt it shows my remaining balance The cahier initially said it is denied we called the manager then they said wait a minute how can a gift card be frozen it is not a credit card and they have never seen a gift card being frozen before They were puzzled I am a regular they know my name when I come in they know my usual they know I pay with my gift card They were very apologetic offered to call the help desk for me I keep coming to that store this whole week and I ask them  have you heard anyting and they are saying no they didnt tell us anything yet it is not working through the register Now today I decided to check out the other eGift card that I have I take it to the store they run the old one  still frozen then they run the brand new one  that one works So I go to panera web site to the gift cards section I check my balance  it shows the correct balance then I email their gift card support The support emails me back with this answer Your request  has been deemed solved I apologize for any inconvenience Please contact Panera Customer Care at  and select the Gift Card Support option They will be happy to assist you Nevermind that my request was not solved So I call that phone number and they write down my card number and my email and phone number and the support person is saying we will get it escalated to the correct person and we will call you back with more information Excuse me I tell the support person I do not need moooore information I need my gift card working
I did not like that process of customer support on eGift cards
Where does it currently stand today I paid 100 for a gift card and I was only able to use half of that amount Not acceptable
Stay tuned as I am planning to post an update if and when I get a resolution

__label__Negative	I ordered two 5000 Gift Cards and one came pretty much destroyed The gift box had no ribbon the package is destroyed  Not happy with the outward appearance of the gift card box  so much for the gift wrapping

This is the first time I had such a problem
__label__Positive	Cute tin

__label__Positive	So some folks I know are hard to buy gifts for but they do like eating in Applebees  Enter this gift card

Enter it into wrapping paper then enter it into their hands and then into their pockets and then into the restaurant that they enjoy

__label__Neutral	Unfortunately I sent it to myself by accident But the real reason for the three stars is that my birthday note was nowhere to be found in the package It wasnt in the card and it wasnt in the envelope enclosed with the card  If it had actually shipped to the intended person that person would not have known who sent it

__label__Neutral	Reading one star reviews here reminds me of a bad joke I learned when I lived in the States briefly Speaking two languages make you a bilingual three makes you a trilingual but if you speak only one that makes you an American People from all over the world buy from Amazon and they dont bother buying these with extra cost because they need them If its not for you then why even bother to show your ignorance People sell these at this price because there are people buying them

__label__Negative	i wasnt sure how to rate this it was easy to buybut trying to use it seemed complicated for anyone of the cashiers that tried to input the information i was successful only one time and still have a remaining balance because it is such a pain in the ass to use so overall i would Not recommend a email card from Safeway
__label__Positive	I really enjoy receiving gift cards  I keep a computer log with the books I purchase with the cards and the prices  This way I know when I am getting close to the amounts
__label__Neutral	I sent this as a gift and the recipient loved the tin that the card arrived in however there was nothing sent with the tin and gift card to indicate WHO the gift was from In the past when I have sent Amazon Gift Cards there has been an option to include a note Not sure why this wasnt an option on this occasion I love the convenience and speed of delivery and would have given 5 stars had it not been for this very disappointing occurrence It resulted in a rather awkward inquiry
__label__Positive	Being able to purchase any time knowing the gift is from people who care

__label__Negative	Sold by E ZEE ELECTRONICS Received a single 100 card I understand that these are popular holiday gifts but if you run out just say so During the time the card took to ship I could have been out getting the multipack from someplace else instead of assuming all was taken care of The single card is useless to me

__label__Positive	Easy and convenient
__label__Positive	Arrived on time Made somebody very happy Love the tiny amazon box it came in
__label__Negative	I was hoping the card could be used for Amazon UK purchases Alas it was not so the recipient had to redeem the card from Amazon USA and pay a lot extra to have the merchandise shipped from Britain

I wish the limitations on this thing were made clearer

Subsequently I sought to buy a gift card from Amazon UK for the same recipient This time my credit card was declined

Perhaps the left hand could better inform the right hand at Amazon so it is truly a worldwide company

__label__Negative	my gift card did not arrive on Saturday as stated in the tracking This was supposed to be a birthday gift which did not make it I was disappointed as well  It has arrived thanks
__label__Positive	Perfect Gift
__label__Negative	Im sure this isnt a popular review but I ordered this card on the 14th of December about 1 oclock in the afternoon and was suppose to have 1 day shipping I was going to send this with other presents we were sending my wifes son who is in the service Im sitting here on December 17th and having to send the rest of the presents without the gift card because for some reason Amazon couldnt put a gift card in a envelope and put in in the mail not only the first day but it took 3 days for them to get it in the mail on one day shipping it was pretty much guaranteed not to get here on time I guess that gift card was to heavy to get out and the people at Amazon had to wait to get help to lift that big bulky card and get it out I went to Wal Mart and got him a gift card so that he would at least have a gift card of some sort I will return Amazons card if it ever gets here Thanks Amazon you were really on the ball with this one Just so everyone knows I dont usually put out negative reviews but felt this one was justified and shows the caring the people at Amazon for their customers UPDATE this was not sent with one day shipping after calling Amazon found out they are shipped from a different company with first class shipping not one day shipping I think the advertising on this needs to be changed

__label__Negative	BEWARE OF FLAVORFUL MOLDED CHEESECAKES AT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY FOR A GREAT TREAT 
All their cheesecakes are shipped in frozen after being made at 1 location
Many cheesecakes can be molded and you will think it is part of the texture and flavoring until you get sick from it
We bought one of their 7 plain cheesecakes and they we nice enough to send us a 20 gift card which their Winter Park Florida store refused to sell us a 7 plain cheesecake for their gift card My son drove 33 miles round trip taking about an hour The manager  employees embarrassed my son in front of many people and he left with the 20 gift card Can you imagine having a person go that distance to be told that he would have to pay extra to receive a replacement for a molded cheesecake
Patricia ONeil 8188713291 was the person who was not so nice to send out a gift card that couldnt even buy a replacement cheesecake After talking to Craig at the main office in California  8188713000 I was told he would send me a 50 gift card for the 33 mile trip and embarrassment given to my son by the manager and employees of their Winter Park store After contacting Patricia ONeil again I was told that 20 was the most they were going to pay and if I wanted a cheesecake I would have to pay the difference and drive 33 miles again What a slap in the face 
Mr David Overton and Mr David Gordon declined to comment

__label__Negative	My daughter won a Kindle and I decided to get her a gift card but the book she wanted was in Amazon UK and the gift card I gave her was for the Amazon in US which she could not use
I am very disappointed
__label__Positive	Worked great So delicious
__label__Positive	I almost forgot about a friend at Christmas so I found their email address and sent this gift card They love it it showed up in a timely manner and there was no issues retrieving the amount I would definitely do this again who knows maybe everyone I know will get emailed gift card this year

__label__Positive	Bought for my niece who loved it
__label__Negative	gift card received is not Snowboarding Snowman design  it is plain black a card  very disappointing as a gift for my nephew
__label__Positive	Gave it as presents Used within a week 1010 would buy again
__label__Positive	Sent this directly to my cousin for Christmas and while it arrived quickly he had to really examine it to figure out who it was from Instead of the gift message being printed inside the card it is in tiny print on the receipt While I enjoy being able to send a gift card directly to my friends and family next time I will likely have it shipped to me first so I can personally inscribe a message on the card

__label__Positive	Bought for my granddaughter who used it to buy apps for her Kindle Fire  It made shopping so much easier for me since her taste and mine are quite different but then I am quite a bit older than she is too  A gift card offers her the chance to shop online and decide for herself what she wants to spend the money on

__label__Positive	Its a gift card It did the job
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards seem always to be well received and quickly spent especially by avid readers and music aficionados Living in America but having family living in the UK would make gift shopping and shipping a chore The gift cards make giving easy and they even denominate the gift in the local currency of the recipient

__label__Positive	got the card looks legit hope it works when I travel this summer
__label__Positive	Great gift card easy and convenient gift for special occasions
__label__Positive	Delivered on time and as described
__label__Positive	I love gift cards 
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Worked well
__label__Positive	Loved the picture in the card
__label__Positive	Great gift idea and so quick and easy to personalize and print out  No trip to the store no second guessing  Our friend loved her gift card
__label__Positive	Ok
__label__Neutral	I about tore it apart thinking it came in an actual box like they did before Glad I saw some glue and left if alone before I gifted it 
__label__Positive	delivered to wrong address
__label__Positive	Great for letting our Grandchildren color the card for Dad
__label__Positive	Always a good gift
__label__Neutral	Obviously getting a gift card is awesome  And I hate to be one to look a gift horse in the mouth  However whats the deal with only being able to use an Amazoncom Gift Card on Amazoncom  Why not Amazoncouk

This may sound nitpicky but consider this just after Christmas on Amazoncouk there was a sale the Twelve Days of Kindle sale  Loads of Kindle Books for real cheap  I got excited browsed through chose which ones I was going to use my gift card on and was set to check out  Looking at the check out page though I realized I wasnt going to be able to use the gift card as it was only good on the US Amazon not the UK Amazon

Im not ungrateful 100 of free books is great even if there are limitations  But why do those limitations exist  Its the same company just a different country  I havent really looked into the legal complications so perhaps theres a good reason why they legally cant allow us to use both sites  However to a layman just using the site it seems a bit unfair that although Im allowed to buy products from the two separate yes yet identical down to for all intents and purposes the logo sites using the same login name I cant use my gift card on both

Like I said maybe its nitpicky  Other than that though gift cards are as one would expect very good
__label__Positive	Item delivered as requested
__label__Positive	I would buy this gift card again it always comes in handy when I have guest
__label__Positive	Very simple and easy to do within the Amazon website I received an email with a minute or so and simply printed out the certificate
__label__Positive	Love the ornament
__label__Positive	Better than candy that she didnt want or flowers that die soon after you get them This will last a very long time as it will be used to buy more Kindle books
__label__Positive	It was perfect
__label__Positive	100 recommended
__label__Negative	I want to cancel my orders
__label__Positive	Great gift card design and perfect for Thanksgiving gifts
__label__Positive	A
__label__Positive	I bought this then gave my friend the code over the internet so he could purchase a game to play with me It works perfectly
__label__Positive	It was my very first time ever using Amazon Wasnt quite sure how it all worked but I soon figured it out Im in total Awe with todays technology because Im very old school I was searching for a last minute Christmas gift  decided to check out what Amazon had to offer And Bingo I found something The gift card email is pure genius Shipping was free  delivery was very prompt My nephew was able to receive his Dave  Busters gift card via email before Christmas Im well over satisfied You have a customer for life with me Love Love LoveAmazon

__label__Positive	Gift for family Apparently 50 does not go very far at Nordstrom You may want to get a 100 or 250
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	It was great for family that is not local Will be using more of them
__label__Positive	Amazon is a little late getting in on the animated cards but better that than not at all A wider selection is needed though
__label__Negative	Amazon didnt include the gift enclosure that told my daughter in law who it was from Glad we called her or she would not have known it was for us I did fill out the gift enclosure card properly online so there is no excuse
__label__Positive	My mom got a Kindle Fire earlier this year and I was going to get her an accessory for it but I didnt know what she already had  This was a great gift for her  The gift card itself arrived the very next day after I ordered it  When I opened the package it was in an envelope and I didnt want to open the envelope so I had to trust that the gift card was inside until mom opened it on Christmas  It was there
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	Though the gift card is shown as being redeemed my greatgrandsons Mom has not ever received the gift certificate via her email
__label__Positive	GREAT GIFTS
__label__Positive	It was fine
__label__Positive	I was so pleased to go through the process of making the gift card and then printing it  This gave me the opportunity to see how well designed the card was  It looked great and the useful information printed on each side of the folded card insured that my brotherinlaw would have no questions unanswered about how to redeem his gift  I felt very good giving this amazon gift card as a holiday gift
__label__Positive	My sister loved it
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a gift card Grandma was pleased Thanks for making gift giving easy I will purchase card again
__label__Positive	I love Amazon gift cards theyre great for my kids and for my grad students when they graduate  My kids particularly love them now that you can buy everything from plastic sporks to entire islands through Amazon  For their birthdays I upload photos of the kids from their earlier baby birthdays to personalize them  My son just got his and said thanks Mom I spent mine on hookers and whiskey although I am reasonably sure that Amazon doesnt carry those
__label__Positive	I gave this five stars  It was so cute with
the owl as the bird  My daughter being the recipient said she absolutely loved it
__label__Positive	It is what it is
__label__Positive	the gift for a friend was greatly needed
__label__Positive	Easy purchase and easy to apply
__label__Positive	My niece loves to purchase photography supplies with Amazon gift card  So this was a perfect gift for her on her birthday

__label__Positive	Delivered fast in a beautiful box well designed
__label__Positive	My daughters and I all have the kindles  I just post this gift card to the account and anyone can just click to buy a book without worries  This way Im giving a gift that keeps giving for all of us to share while maintaining my pocket book for the month  Love it

__label__Positive	I ordered this gift card for my older sister because she is far from me and I wanted to give her something for her birthday
Very pleased and so was she
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card was great It was nice to be able to spend it like I wanted to and not have to purchase an item that I didnt really want
__label__Positive	I received this as a Christmas gift after purchasing the Kindle Fire  The perfect gift  It can be used for any Amazoncom purchase
__label__Positive	I purchased this as a birthday gift for my niece who is an avid reader because I had noticed that one of her favorite authors has a new book due to be published soon  These cards are always my gift solution when there is no obvious special something the recipient wants and they never fail to please  I just heard that she has already spent it  along with a couple of other Amazon cards she received
__label__Positive	It was a perfect gift
__label__Positive	Easy order
__label__Neutral	Hotelscom restricts gift card use to specific hotels
__label__Positive	this was a good work around when I was not allowed to order from the USA thru to customs from Amazoncom  so I had to order the banned product send package from Amazon to a friend in the USA mailing addres  and they then shipped Back to to me  trouble was how to get to them the cash need for this transaction  answer   The Amazon gift card  worked great and they can use the card for any thing the desire 
__label__Positive	Great gift card worked as expected
__label__Positive	Very beautiful and timely delivery really a great experience with the seller
__label__Positive	Sold it right away for more than I bought it for

__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card when you just have no clue what to get for someone  The vast inventory and fast shipping make Amazon my go to place for Gift Cards
__label__Neutral	it took a long time to go though had to be chased
__label__Positive	I loved like and will bay again

__label__Positive	So convenient
__label__Positive	Worked as expected

__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	I love Amazonfast shipping no troubles with anything
__label__Positive	We happen to have nice card stock so it was easy to print out and personalize for a moving to a new home gift card  The fact that it could be done minutes before needed is great for anyone who has procrastinated in the gift buying or just needs a gift that fits all at the last minute

__label__Positive	Perfect  Thanks
__label__Positive	What can I say  A nice gift card arrived on time in a nicelooking greeting card  Worked for me
__label__Positive	Nice gift just fine
__label__Positive	Exactly as its advertised
__label__Positive	I love this
__label__Positive	Already spent by recipient
__label__Positive	This is what our relative asked for
__label__Positive	Bloomin Onions are fire yo
__label__Negative	A huge disappointment The card came through without my photo and my complaint to amazoncom went unacknowledged Furthermore my son sent a gift card to my wife and the photo he had specially wanted on the card was also missing Dont offer a service you cant provide amazoncom Not impressed and wouldnt bother another time so anyone out there who is thinking of purchasing a gift card with a personal photo forget it
__label__Positive	Listen if you dont mind the person knowing how much you spent on gift or you do not appreciate person returning your well thought out gift then give them an Amazon gift card  Quick easy and efficient and Amazon has something for everyone Lets be real a kid can find out the price you spent in about 20 seconds these days so why not cut out all the hassle and misery of gift giving
__label__Positive	I love giving Amazon gift cards I do try to stay on top of birthdays but sometimes they just slip by me SO I know that I can give a Amazon Gift card and it is delivered immediatly and the lucky person gets to use it asap Plus with our busy lives and we move farther apart it is difficult to know what they like or need so this way they can buy what they want and like And even better they have to buy something fun and not put the money on bills
__label__Positive	An Amazon Gift Card is a wonderful gift and the animated gift card made it that much more touching
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	Bought for my daughter she loved it

__label__Positive	It was delivered on time The message was correctly and attractively displayed The recipients were both pleased and used it for their twin girls soon to be borm
__label__Positive	Its a gift card what could be wrong
__label__Positive	I gave this to my sister as a Mothers Day gift She is a voracious reader and used it right away
__label__Positive	Picked this up on Black Friday as Lightning Deal that was too good to pass up and Ive never had a bad meal or cocktail at Applebees so this was a total nobrainer My only regret is that I could only purchase one of them Going to share the love with some friends and give them a casual night out
__label__Positive	Whats not to love about a gift card
And this one was even better because it came as part of a promotion with a wii system
Ive already used it towards purchasing some needed accessories so perfect
__label__Negative	Photo did not show on gift email  Disappointed
__label__Positive	Great price and fun food
__label__Positive	My mothers day gift was greatly appreciated  My mother loves to order books for her kindle and this way she can get whatever she wants

__label__Positive	Life Savor
__label__Positive	I love that I can email this gift on the day it is needed  Great idea for those that procrastinate
And what is better than letting them pick something they want not giving them something that
will sit on a shelf or worse yet in a closet
__label__Positive	Arrived in plenty of time to give as a gift  Was told very easy to use  Was better than a cash gift and was appreciated
__label__Positive	It suits me as I get to spend the voucher on what I want and it is delivered to my home

__label__Positive	Its always a joy to be able to use a gift card to purchase an ebook and its such a nice way to treat someone
__label__Positive	Exactly what I needed
__label__Positive	We love Outback and so does our family  This made the perfect gift

__label__Positive	My friend loved it
__label__Positive	Such a cool idea My grandson loved getting it
__label__Positive	was a nice birthday present
__label__Positive	Great deal for this card Pay less and get more if your going anyway
__label__Positive	Great wonderful gift
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Fantastic
__label__Positive	My niece was very happy to receive
__label__Positive	Made my gift receiver happy What more can I ask
__label__Negative	Not at all And you are probably asking how can a gift card be so disappointing Well  Lets start by stating I ordered 161 gift cards at 25 each and not 1 of them was activated If you dont have a calculator handy that is a total of 4025  These were purchased by the company I work for and are intended as prizes to our partners  we found out they were not active when one of the recipients of this gift card couldnt purchase her meal because it wasnt activated I was hoping it was an isolated incident however after checking a few of the other enclosed cards those werent activated either Now I have to wait for them to investigate this matter Will absolutely never buy from this vendor again
__label__Positive	My son has an Amazon account  Whenever he has a birthday or around Christmas it is so easy to go in my account buy the gift card and have it posted to his account  He has a Kindle and buys lots of books from Amazoncom  Winwin for us both  Easy for me and it gives him what he enjoys  Also it doesnt contribute to his necktie collection
__label__Positive	I buy myself gift cards when I have extra money for those tough times Ive had this for 2 years now and still dont think I need to use it unless I go crazy on Christmas presents
__label__Positive	Worth it delivered to my house so I didnt have to go out of my way to buy them at the store If you are planning to gift to several people this would be great for you Yes there was some glue but it took 5 seconds to remove
__label__Positive	its a gift card who doesnt like money
__label__Positive	Whats not great about a QVC gift card  I bought it for my sisterinlaw who is a QVCaholic
__label__Positive	Love to eat at applebees always good food and like now that they have meals with weight watchers points listed
__label__Positive	For a gift this was great
__label__Negative	Amazon PrimeDay is the biggest scam Was watchingwaiting for this gift card along with 2 others Never was actually able to because it listed as full within the first minute of launch Challenging even havingpaying for this exclusive amazon prime membership thats clearly a joke Very disappointed
__label__Positive	My daughter shops online frequently and finds items that are often not offered in the retail stores after attempting a couple of purchases off her list I went to Amazon found this easy way for her to shop for herself took less than a minute to order and print out card will definitely use this again
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Perfect and delivered exactly when requested
__label__Positive	I have received two gift cards to date  The first one did not have the name of the person who had sent it  If I hadnt known it was coming I wouldnt have known who sent it  The second one came the way it should have  Very easy to apply to my account and very easy to use once it is applied to the account
__label__Positive	goodbut i havent received 10 back
__label__Positive	We gave this to a grandchild who lives out of state  He seems to enjoy picking his own Christmas  birthday gifts
__label__Positive	Too cute and adds a lot to the gift card presentation
__label__Positive	I bought this for myself lol it took about 20 min but  that is responsible since it was for 250 but normally I buy less then 100 and it comes in a matter of minutes
__label__Positive	Great gift for an out of state baby
__label__Positive	It was the speediest shopping trip ever  So easy
__label__Positive	What an awesome deal I shopped online for Amazon gift cards and had them mailed to my house for no charge
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	This gift card was a Christmas gift and I love it because Amazon sell everything and it was an obvious choice to get for someone that alreadt has everything
__label__Positive	Always love my gift certificates from Amazon  They arrive with free one day shipping easy to upload to my account and allows me to buy all the books and movies I want  Cant go wrong
__label__Positive	Although there was no discount on the 150 Amazon gift card the inclusion of the teddy bear made me buy it  The teddy bear is very nice quality super soft and very cute  It will make a great donation for a child shelter for Christmas
__label__Negative	I ordered my tickets the day before the movie an hour before we were going to go watch it my sin gets the stomach flu No refunds on fandango or credit for same movie diff day Lost 22 bucks Will never use fandango again
__label__Positive	doesnt get better for a Christmas gift
__label__Positive	useful
__label__Positive	the Amazon gift card is extremely useful because of the fact that you can buy almost anything off of Amazoncom Amazon is a site like no other because of the fact that other sellers put up their items on Amazon My Amazon gift card was undoubtedly one of the best things that i got for christmas I highly recommend this as a gift for just about anybody
__label__Positive	Easy way to send a gift to a friend overseas Now they can buy exactly what they want  no awkward returns
__label__Negative	Bought 4 or 5 and most did not work
__label__Positive	Cute A perfect gift for a graduate
__label__Positive	It was quick easy safe  best way to gift someone

Rather than going out and getting the stuffs which is so time consuming Just on a click i was ready with the gift
__label__Positive	Received this gift card for 20 during a lightning deal  I know many people are down on Panda Express because it is not authentic Chinese food but I like the food and this gift card helps purchase some when my funds are a little low  I buy the gift cards and use them when we normally go or will use them when money is tight right before payday  The lightning deals are great and will save you between 5 and 20 depending on how much you spend
__label__Positive	awesome everything as promised
__label__Positive	This was the EASIEST and most convenient gift Ive ever purchased  I bought it printed it out signed it then brought it with me to visit my friend  She loved it
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	Really a life saver Purchased last minute for a baby shower She loved it Very fast cute and easy to create  There is no excuse not to have something to give to friends and family last minute May purchase these for Xmas presents
__label__Positive	Made saying thank you quick and easy  Thanks for having the electronic option for gift cards Easy to use Easy delivery
__label__Positive	I was VERY happy to be able to purchase an online gift card for my friend who was expecting her third baby because she lives in a different state from me over 3 hours away so it was VERY convenient to be able to send her a gift card online  She was then able to use it to purchase whatever she neededwanted  I also appreciated the fact that I was able to choose from several different styles pictures for the gift card and could choose whatever amount I wanted  This gift card definitely met my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone
__label__Positive	A good deal
__label__Positive	cool gift 
__label__Positive	Good I still have some money left on my card
__label__Positive	Worked no problem and had fun using it
__label__Positive	This was a wonderful way to send a gift for the new child who has everything

__label__Positive	I had a friend who was getting ready to move so the last thing she needed was more toys or other things at her daughters birthday party to pack for the move  It was easy to purchase the gift card and I liked that I was able to print something to put inside the card and have to email her later in the event it go missplaced so she could still use it
__label__Positive	pretty for a xmas gift and had a nice card to go with the gift card  was shipped very fast also
__label__Neutral	Cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card  But the card could have been nicer
__label__Positive	Excellent in many ways

__label__Positive	The Amazon eGift card is great and has easy instructions to print it from anywhere here is also a handy email option also if youd like to go that route
__label__Negative	I ordered two 50 cards received email stating they could not be programmed after I received them  They sent me two more received another email stating they could not be programmed after I received them again  Thus the carnival was upon us so we ended up getting a 50 Target Card and 50 WalMart Card instead

Ah ha enter the Amazon printable gift card Its from Amazon so OF COURSE anyone you give it to is sure to find something theyll actually like and by adding a little message inside I was able to personalize a bit Plenty of choices for birthdays and just about any major event worth celebrating the hardest part was picking which design to go with

__label__Negative	I ordered this for a Christmas gift I was going to do a printathome gift card but I thought the little tin container was cute and would be something cute to wrap I shouldve just ordered the printathome one The card arrived in the container fine and was really cute I wrapped it and gave it as the gift A couple days later I received a text from the recipient saying that the gift card didnt work That was pretty embarrassing So I emailed customer service and they informed me that that the gift card was never activated on their end before it was sent The person I dealt with said she would activate it but if it still didnt work she was refunding me my money and asked me to use that refund to reorder one of their email gift cards to send to the person Well the gift card I initially sent still did not work when it was activated so I had to go and order another one to be sent by email and wait for the refund to hit my credit card I wont be purchasing another gift card like this again I will stick to the printathome or email ones At least I know that those will work

__label__Positive	HaHaHa  We buy so much stuff from Amazon that I thought itd be fun for my daughters doll to get a package in the mail There are magnets that open and close the box and even a faux tape seam  We just used the gift card for our regular amazon purchasesand now the American Girl doll can get packages delivered  Its a really cute box
__label__Positive	Every thing was great Will do it again 
__label__Negative	Buy it here I bought a digital 100 gift card directly from the Outback web site so I could buy my parents dinner today in another city and didnt receive an email confirmation of payment So I called the customer service number and found that Outback holds the payment for up to 24 hours before sending the digital card or even a receipt for payment

Thats the first online purchase Ive ever made among thousands that didnt provide an instant receipt And whats the point of an email gift card if you cant send it that day anyway I wanted to post a warning to other customers but there is no place to do so on the Outback web site
__label__Positive	Great condition as promised thanks alot for amazing service cannot wait to use it love it  thanks so much
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	I never received any notice that gift card was undeliverable to the email I submitted My granddaughter did NOT get her birthday present and was too polite to tell me she got nothing Why wouldnt Amazon have something trigger to check in with me about that
When I went into my account to try to change email  this was not an option nor was there any info on how to proceed under the circumstance PLEASE advise
__label__Positive	I really do enjoy the gift card system on Amazon It makes things a lot easier when your an online shopper
__label__Positive	Great Anniversary Present  My Daughter  My SoninLaw loved it

__label__Positive	Easy to do  the recipient enjoyed it
__label__Positive	I would recommend this to anyone who doesnt have the time or the cash to go shopping for a gift They were delivered on time as advertised  Only issue was the image I uploaded did not display correctly on my friends Windows Phone Lumia 920 it was pushed half way to the right so only the left half of the photo was displayed She had to reopen it on her iPad This may be a bug that needs attention

__label__Positive	Good way to give gift
__label__Positive	We all have those people at Christmas we want to show our appreciation but we dont know what they like or they have a monetary limit for gifts My postman and UPS person are those kind of people and I find that a gift card is the perfect gift By giving a gift card from Amazon they can choose from any product something that suits their fancy

My postman has given me a card of thanks and told me how much he appreciated the gift These little things mean a lot to the giver and recipient It brings a little cheer in a time that is wrought with strife Happy Holidays

__label__Positive	Love to go for Sundayfry chicken dinner
__label__Positive	It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did I appreciated so much thanks again Carlena
__label__Negative	I send these gift cards often to nieces and nephews and have been doing so for years but Im going to have to go elsewhere  I cant believe how lame and stagnant this product is for a company as big and resourceful as Amazon  I like the singing animated versions and I have used up every possibility even tho the choices are pretty weak  Its nice to be able to upload your own photo but then theres no animation or sound  I would pay more for more variety or possibilities  I liked Amazon cards because they are so easy to use track schedule reminders resend if necessary and Amazon has such a broad product range and unlike others here I have rarely had a problem  But sadly Im embarrassed to send any more
__label__Positive	Brilliant characters  Enjoyed every moment of this story  Original and clever
__label__Negative	Huge ripoff Purchased this in store They read the balance but said they couldnt finish the activation process Were out 25 dollars
__label__Positive	very satisfied  received fast
__label__Negative	is not excepted by Amazon India
__label__Positive	Ive been able to send my little cousin a giftcard as she was upset about not being able to celebrate her birthday with the rest of family after relocating to the US She was very happy to receive it and we both loved the cute animation Just like any other product sold on Amazon I could be sure that the card would reach her and that shed be able to redeem it With Amazon you get what you pay for We are all very thankful
__label__Positive	Very nice gift card package Amazon delivered right in time and it came in a wonderful box Might as well get an Amazon gift card with a little box if you are going to get a gift card
__label__Positive	I loved the amazon gift card I enjoy being able to get my books right away without worrying about having enough money for my purchase I would recommend having an amazon gift card to anyone who simply loves to read  ITS GREAT
__label__Positive	The gift card arrived the day after I ordered it PLUS it came with a Mothers Day Card How perfect of a gift for the person who doesnt necessarily have time to go to the store to pay a gift Just Awesome
__label__Positive	I thought this was a very nice design in the spirit of Christmas especially for a commercial product Most others are too noncommittal

__label__Positive	She loved it
__label__Positive	Great and fast
__label__Positive	Great quick shipping very satisfied
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Cute card holder
__label__Neutral	None of my Gift Cards arrived too their Email on Christmas So I had too go back  forth with my kids too see if they Ever got it 
 I Ended up having 2 RE Send them ALL 3 days after XMas 
__label__Positive	they are perfect for every occasion and the kids love them  totally love the ease of sending a gift thanks
__label__Negative	First of all this would not play or open on my KINDLE FIRE  How do you order a video on Amazon and it not even play on THEIR device  Secondly it did not play on my moms iPad either  She found that retrieving the information about her gift was difficult certainly not user friendly at all  I had to log into her facebook account and her Amazon account to figure it out myself which wasnt that easy for me either  This idea needs a TON of improvement  Make sure the adorable video can play on different platforms and that retrieving the gift card is relatively simple
__label__Positive	It is cute and elegant Four stars because the tray that holds the card falls out easily
__label__Positive	The convenience of a gift card is great Thanks a lot
__label__Positive	The card was received on time however I was not impressed that it was publicly posted on Facebook and will never do this kind of purchase again
__label__Positive	The box with the gift card came the next day  Fabulous gift  The recipient loved it she will be able to purchase whichever kindle books she would like
__label__Positive	Everything was absolutely perfect  I couldnt have asked for more    I was extremely pleased as I am with all of my purchases from Amazon
__label__Positive	Gift Card are our favorite gift to receive  giveyoure receiving or sending all the fun of selecting from a huge array of possibilities
__label__Positive	Grandchildren enjoyed it immensely
__label__Positive	Always nice to give or receive
__label__Positive	Great last minute gift idea
__label__Positive	Very good for everyone you can get what you want with a gift card

__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are always great especially in a pinch
__label__Positive	good product
__label__Positive	They really appreciated it
__label__Positive	Great Gift for my daughter in Hawaii
__label__Positive	I use this as birthday gift for a family member they loved it All I did was color it in
__label__Positive	Yes wish there were more like it on amazon
__label__Positive	On time  greatly appreciated by recipient
__label__Positive	everyone loves these
__label__Positive	Made it easy for a long distance wedding we were unable to attend Arrived with perfect timing
__label__Positive	Bought this for my friend who graduated from college and she loves it
__label__Positive	I liked the way I didnt have to wait for the mail to bring this I wanted it at the last min and liked the way
I could print it out and have it right away Would do it again

thanksPat
__label__Positive	I made good by helping out a friend

I was glad someone said thank you
__label__Positive	The card that it came in was a very nice card Made the gift card look so much better
__label__Positive	rege
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Negative	I did not understand this post
__label__Positive	Got great eats with it
__label__Positive	I like getting gift cards at discounted prices
__label__Positive	Granddaughters request for Christmas
__label__Positive	Gift for my daughter in law   Love the container and gift card
__label__Positive	Delivered promptly
__label__Positive	very easy to print enjoy giving to friends would buy again  Wonderful gift for friend or family  Dont know what else to say
__label__Positive	Looks a little cheap but it is cheap so you get what you pay for Will certainly do the job at my wedding
__label__Positive	Love the snowflake tin box
__label__Negative	Did not work when the person that I purchased it for as a gift tried to use it at the store She spent 45 minutes on the phone with Amazon to no avail
__label__Positive	so easy to do
__label__Neutral	It was supposed to be a thank you card  
__label__Negative	i ordered the card with a monetary gift and the card never arrived  just the money I was very disappointed
__label__Positive	Self explanatory Gift box is nice and pretty design on the card is attractive receiver of gift happy Easy to redeem
__label__Negative	I was scammed into payment through an Amazon gift card and no one was able to return the funds I lost
__label__Positive	Was perfect to give with the foto of the your lovely family If you dont have an idea what give this is the perfect option and you friend will enjoy it
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Neutral	The cardboard backing was dirty and bent and the card itself was also dirty and had scratches on it  At least the balance was what I ordered when I checked it  Giving as a gift so rather disappointed that I had to take the card off the cardboard and wash it
__label__Positive	Those gift cards are the best thing to give to teenagers and young adults  They arrived promptly as promised and are very nicely gift wrapped  I love them
__label__Positive	It is a gift card and as far as I know the people who got it are happy  I would be
__label__Positive	Nephew loved got right on time
__label__Positive	Great gift Card was loaded when my friend received it
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Good deal
__label__Neutral	This is an Amazon 25 gift card You can use it to purchase items on amazon that are worth less the same or more than 25 If you use it to purchase an item or items that cost more than 25 then you have to provide an additional funding source  I dont think that they take bitcoin or Icelandic Krona though can someone research that for us
If you lose the card like some do then you are out 25 I think that it is easier to lose this card than to lose cash
Also sometimes your Amazon purchases are taxed so the Govt gets some of your gift card I wonder what the Govt does with that tax  Hopefully they are buying more weapons
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are always the right size and always welcome by recipients  They arrive on time and can be used immediately  Save on gas too
__label__Positive	Great generic gift
__label__Positive	Worked fine
__label__Positive	These are a great gift for long or short distance instant delivery for people you want to have a super quality gift of exactely what they want as Amazon sells everything under the sun
__label__Positive	Great Product
__label__Positive	This was a request from my son  We get one of these for him every year  It is cheaper here than anywhere else
__label__Positive	It was great to get this to use for a birthday gift for a friend They loved it
__label__Negative	Bought as birthday gift  Recipient didnt try to use it for about 6 months and then got a message indicating it was no longer valid  That was really embarrassing  I went into my account and found an option to resend the digital card which I did  I have not heard back whether the recipient has tried to use it  Id like to know why this problem occurred  As I said  embarrassing
__label__Positive	a great gift
__label__Positive	Good quality
__label__Positive	Love Amazon gift cards  So simple to use and the recipient gets exacty what they want
__label__Positive	Great gift card fast and easy
__label__Positive	Good gift for a teen
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and came with a great little case Perfect for christmas gifts and not wanting to leave the house
__label__Positive	Great restaurant great atmosphere delicious food
__label__Positive	This is the easiest most appreciated last minute gift idea  Dont even have to leave the house yet still are able to give a nice gift
__label__Positive	it was a fun day with the entire family 
__label__Positive	This was greatgrandson is in Florida and it was a great choice for him
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	all good I recommend it good service all fast and nigun problem I recommend it 100 good product for all
__label__Positive	fast and easy
__label__Negative	I have been ordering these for years for my nieces and nephews  In the past the denomination was written on the card  This year you have to match the bar code on the bottom of the box with the packing slip  Now instead of just wrapping I have to put a note in the box staring the amount of the gift card  It will look very tacky and embarrassing but thankfully they are all the same amount
__label__Positive	This product is ingenious Now I have an onhand gift at all times My only complain about Amazon gift cards in general is that Amazon requires you to load the card onto your account in order to check the balance for multiple family members sharing one account this could prove problematic This idea in and of itself however is a marketing grandslam Cards arrived quickly but will not ship on their own as addon item only
__label__Positive	I was really happy about how easy it was to email the gift card to my dad no worries about printing
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Came fast and looks very nice
__label__Positive	My brother enjoyed this Christmas present and its something he can really use I am very satisfied
__label__Negative	The box was delivered at an odd time550 in the eveningand blended into the wall which it was near  My sister thought she had not received it and had to do a search  I will have to think of something else for her next birthday
__label__Positive	EXCELENTE
__label__Positive	My Mom loved the gift card
__label__Positive	Very nice Super Good A
__label__Positive	IT IS SO EASY TO SEND THE GIFT CARD SAVES TIME BY NOT HAVING TO BUY AT A LOCAL STORE
__label__Positive	It worked out very well  As a matter of fact I need another gift card to the same person THIS VERY DAY
__label__Positive	We give employees a choice for their yearsofservice awards to either receive a specific gift item like a piece of jewelry etc or an Amazon gift card and they choose Amazon about 65 of the time  They are easy to purchase and easy to use
__label__Positive	Buying gifts can be a minefield so take the safe way out buying a gift card It is so easy that you can forget to order it right up to the last minute and not be a cant use right word
__label__Positive	Well obviously the gift card is exactly what you expect it to be  The teddy bear wasnt bad especially since it was free
__label__Positive	great place to eat
__label__Positive	The whole process was easy and the recipient was happy with it
__label__Positive	Bought as gift  recipient loved it  More the amount I think than the color  Amazon gift cards are always appreciated
__label__Negative	not as true wast of 82 dollars
__label__Positive	On time and as expected
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	This was a Christmas Stocking present for my daughter and I think she loved this more than the other more expensive gifts
__label__Positive	Received on time and was much appreciated by the grandkids who promptly spent them for games on their kindles
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	beautiful presents for all ages
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are a great present and I give them often  The card was a great touch and everything was in perfect condition
__label__Positive	No Problems
__label__Positive	Bought this card for my nieces birthday  She tried to eat it  Youd think a 30 year old woman would know the difference  Oh well
__label__Negative	Amazon guaranteed that this Christmas gift card will be delivered on December 24 2013

UPS notified me on Dec 24th that the gift card will not be delivered till December 26 the day after Christmas Whats the point of making a promise that they could not keep

It was more than just an inconvenience for us We were buying this gift card for my sons best friend as his Christmas present We didnt choose the electronic gift card because we thought we could present him a nice little gift box It turned out to be an embarrassment for us on the Christmas eve

I have received emails from both Amazon and UPS regarding the late delivery They were pointing fingers at each other UPS said Amazon did not make it in time for pick up Amazon said UPS had a break down on their transportation network Amazon did apologize in a separate email and offered compensation However there was no apology from UPS

It doesnt matter now The fact was its late and AmazonUPS have failed The lesson learned here is that if timing is important then go with electronic gift card
__label__Positive	Great I even colored the picture in What a great idea My Kris Kringle loved it
__label__Positive	Giving Amazon Gift Cards has been the best thing for giving on any occasion  They are easy to acquire simple for the recipient to use and always efficient  I will continue to buy and give these gift cards simply because everyone that receives them loves to use these Amazon Gift Cards
__label__Positive	The egift card arrived almost immediately and I had no problems placing an order online
__label__Positive	I havent heard from the recipients that they have had any trouble using the gift card so I expect that means they were able to spend it without any problems So I guess I am very happy with the way the purchase worked out  I purchased gift cards from another site that made it difficult to use them and I was very disappointed with that site
__label__Negative	i chose a wedding card instead I received a amazon kindle card that looks like the card can only be used for kindle products
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	My sister loved it
__label__Positive	Great ease On the spot printable gift card without having to make a choice they may not like Would definitely consider it again and suggest it to others
__label__Positive	Came with what I needed
__label__Positive	Great Christmas gift My grand kids love them
__label__Positive	Gift cards are much easier to read the scratch off number now There was a recent redesign that eliminated the issue with scratching off the numbers under the surface THANK YOU
__label__Positive	for a gift to my sister nothing better than this cardsimple as that
__label__Negative	Terrible since it was already activated and not redeemable on an account that was already in existence to add to
__label__Positive	Great gift for the person who has nearly everythingor for the person who likes to pick out their own gift

__label__Negative	BEWARE OF FLAVORFUL MOLDED CHEESECAKES AT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY FOR A GREAT TREAT 
All their cheesecakes are shipped in frozen after being made at 1 location
Many cheesecakes can be molded and you will think it is part of the texture and flavoring until you get sick from it
We bought one of their 7 plain cheesecakes and they we nice enough to send us a 20 gift card which their Winter Park Florida store refused to sell us a 7 plain cheesecake for their gift card My son drove 33 miles round trip taking about an hour The manager  employees embarrassed my son in front of many people and he left with the 20 gift card Can you imagine having a person go that distance to be told that he would have to pay extra to receive a replacement for a molded cheesecake
Patricia ONeil 8188713291 was the person who was not so nice to send out a gift card that couldnt even buy a replacement cheesecake After talking to Craig at the main office in California  8188713000 I was told he would send me a 50 gift card for the 33 mile trip and embarrassment given to my son by the manager and employees of their Winter Park store After contacting Patricia ONeil again I was told that 20 was the most they were going to pay and if I wanted a cheesecake I would have to pay the difference and drive 33 miles again What a slap in the face 
Mr David Overton and Mr David Gordon declined to comment

__label__Positive	Easy fast and surprisingly easy to read and enter
__label__Positive	Quick and easy gift that everyone always likes
__label__Negative	If you put a gift card in a greeting card wouldnt you think there would be an easy option to put a personal message in the card  Maybe I missed something but the recipient couldnt even tell who sent them the gift until I told them by telephone
__label__Positive	A great gift idea
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Great card
__label__Neutral	I have a balance on this card and Jack in the box  3 times now cannot get it to work Not sure what the issue is if its the card or jack in the box but Id really like to get what I paid for

__label__Neutral	I sent this gift card as a birthday gift to my niece She received it and did not know who it was from since the gift message we wrote was never included in the package My brother had to call around to see who sent it He did say that the actual gift card was cute
__label__Positive	Very convenient gift for the amazon user
__label__Positive	This gift was happily received
__label__Negative	I was actually looking for a Nintendo gift card and bought it by mistake I dont know why it appeared on my search but I cant get a refund

__label__Positive	Had trouble selecting a nice card but who cares it was sent anyway
__label__Negative	Usually do not have a problem w Gift cards from Amazon
I bout two 100 cards One for each sons birthdays close together Amazon sent me an email saying card could not be validated so they were sending another two Nice of Amazonbut this made me miss their day
The two that came also could not be activated
I ended up getting a refund  ordering an eMail Gift card sent to each of their addresses  printed out this worked but boy what a hassle
__label__Positive	Makes a terrific gift
__label__Positive	So easy
__label__Positive	Amazon gifts cards are the perfect present for me Whenever anyone asks what I want for my birthday I say an Amazon gift card

__label__Positive	got there fast
__label__Positive	I love that Amazon will include this nice ornament gift box with the gift card for free plus we received this and another one we ordered the next day even during all that crazy UPS Christmas delivery problems this year
__label__Negative	I dont understand why this did not show up in my friends email It was very embarrassing since she probably though I forgot her birthday I tried it twice I would think this would have been easy to do with amazon but somehow they blew it
__label__Positive	Perfect card packaging for my granddaughter who makes delicious fancy cupcakes

__label__Positive	Good product  Bought this for my brothers new kindle and the transaction was smooth and the process was easy  thanks

__label__Positive	Great stuff
__label__Positive	What is NOT to like about AMAZON GIFT CARD
__label__Positive	I didnt realize this was a wedding gift card  I gave this to my mom for her birthday bc I thought the butterflies were pretty  I wonder if she realized it looks like a wedding cake  Well it does not matter anyway
__label__Positive	Daughter loved it

__label__Positive	a convient way to give a friend a gift
__label__Positive	This is a lifesaver for procrastinators like me who forget to get gifts until the last minute
__label__Positive	Amazon Photo Gift Card  You should be prepared to shock the person that you sent the card to  My son could not believe that his mother could or would come up with such a great idea Because my son lives in Europe the gift card along with our personal Happy Birthday was so easy for me No packing no wrapping no postage just a gift that allows him to make a purchase that he will truly enjoy  Great Idea
__label__Neutral	We purchased 2 50 gift cards  which included the promo of receiving a 20 credit The gift cards were great and the recipients loved them Unfortunately for us we never recieved our 20 credit as indicated by the promo
__label__Positive	I use the cards for customer rewards and am able to upload our logo to make the gift look very professional
__label__Positive	not much to say nice package
__label__Positive	EXECELENT
__label__Positive	Perfect and easy for a birthday gift  Just picked the amount the sarcastic card and click send It was there in minutes  so it was super fast and you can personalize it as much as you want

__label__Positive	Good deal when you get it as a discounted gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift idea with speedy e delivery
__label__Positive	Simple card design great for stocking stuffers
__label__Positive	The recipient loved the gift card Thank you for making gift giving so easy
__label__Positive	Gift was very nice love container The container will be used on the tree for years to come This is my 3 yr Buying gift cards for grand son
__label__Positive	She loved it and thought it was really cute  
__label__Positive	This was a gift for our niece and she LOVED it  I really just needed a Kindle giftcard so I was so happy to find this Amazon gift card with the Kindle logo so our niece knew what it was intended for 
__label__Positive	Excenlent
__label__Positive	Could not print card emailed it to someone who printed it for me  Do not know if it was the format from Amazon or my printer that did not workI suspect it was the format
__label__Positive	I write to recommend these gift cards as a handsome addition to anyones pockets I have purchased them for family members for friends for inamorata and for myself so that when Im strolling through the mall or out busily driving to and fro in my car Ill stop and think THE OLIVE GARDEN I would no doubt think of it anyway because once you have experienced their food theres no going back to anything lesser CHILIS Their alfredo sauce will almost make your mouth stagger off your face in delight

The last time I was there I asked SCOTT the waiter for more breadsticks and he promptly brought them I asked him if he thought ZITI was a strange name for a food and he said hed never thought about it before It sounds like a noise an animal makes I said Just because it sounds funny SCOTT explained doesnt mean it doesnt taste good SCOTT I said that is very true Then we both leaned back and enjoyed a laugh Someone should give SCOTT a promotion

I would offer one complaint about this fine restaurant which is that they are fairly inflexible about letting you customize your dining experience I know a local singersongwriter IVAN MALESKY MD and a few months ago I tried to hire him to serenade my table at the local OG He is perhaps best known for the song My Neighbors Shoes a marvelous uplifting song about fellowship and brotherhood It was followed by the sequels Neighbors Pants Neighbors Robe and Neighbors Wife a series that becomes increasingly vehement and artistically challenging But I assured the OLIVE GARDEN he would express only mainstream emotions during his time in their fine establishment

No response

I wrote again to assure them that the man is extremely lowmaintenance He brings his own stepladder and has a surprisingly easygoing demeanor He would touch their patrons in a metaphorical way ONLY with a profound basso mysterioso that shivers the heart strings to the timeless frequencies of human longing His actual hands he would keep to himself I imagined he would run through his repertoire of popular standards and then do some hingeless jazz soloing when the food arrived He would of course ask for tips I cautioned or have his assistant BON waddle around with a hat But this gives the performance a classic outdoor feel and allows IVAN to finance his disparate endeavors

No response

I admit at this point getting a little bit gravely disappointed in the OLIVE GARDEN It seemed inexplicable to me that my favorite restaurant would refuse to EVEN ANSWER a loyal patron after so many unbroken of friendship and what they call HOSPITALIANO I thought back over all those meals Ive had and all those times I plunked five or six new gift card on the table at once as if to say lets make something happen So in a fit of what might be called FRUSTRANGINI I did something that I must confess I am not proud of It is hard for me to admit but in the interests of full disclosure I will say it

I went to BENNIGANS

Perhaps six times It was not the same Its not that the food is bad at BENNIGANS  one time I had the lemonish salad with chicken fragments over spicey spice But it just lacks that special something You just dont feel like youre being swept away to a faraway place as you do in the OLIVE GARDEN I think thats why I enjoy the GIFT CARDS so much for they add to the fantasy of being outside the usual parameters of time and space Also I did not have the same kind of jokey rapport with the waitstaff at BENNIGANS This is not a knock on BRITTNEY KAYLA JOSH RICKI or LINBEE who were all very prompt and competent except JOSH but they did not have the expertise that you find with a SCOTT Also my water had something floating in it I dont think it was a flea but I also dont think it was something a patron wants to have to try to block with his lips while he tries to enjoy his water

This experience made me realize that the OLIVE GARDEN is more than just food served on plates by waiters for money theres an idea there Its an idea about returning to a simpler time and a simpler place that echoes deep within the bowels of the human heart You can see why they are the worlds most successful horizontally distributed multinational restaurant conglomeration

OG finally did respond to my questions with a firm but polite NO It didnt matter because the special event had come and gone and MALESKY had stopped doing restaurant work to focus his energy on studio recording and his various ongoing lawsuits

Despite this disappointment I did return Indeed I have decided to put aside our differences and continue to enjoy an exhilarating foodbased relationship with the OG Theres just something about the place that makes it impossible to stay away for long Also I had four gift cards left But in this way reader we come full circle to the true value of the gift card Sometimes it forces you to eat at OLIVE GARDEN when you really dont want to But youll always be glad you did
__label__Positive	Just as expected  A1
__label__Negative	The supporting software for buying this guift card was not friendly  I couldnt tell if I had the card ordered and paid for so ended up circling around  I sent this to my son via his email personal email  BUT when I went back in several hours to check on the gift card I got a message saying resend  SO being totally trusting of Amazon I resent the gift card to my sons military email address  To top it all off my son received two valid gift cards but when he tried to use the first one it defaulted  He waited a couple days and the gift card at the military address did finally work  I dont want to repeat this experience again
__label__Positive	My credit card statement was very lengthy because of the number of ebooks I was buying and not all of them at once  After receiving one from my Son as a gift and recognizing how easy it is to immediately download it to my account I now buy the Gift Card for myself   and my credit card statement is much shorter
__label__Positive	So I purchased this item for a christmas gift It came within 5 days of the purchase which is a good time considering I used amazons super free shipping When it arrived there was a paper inside that said access your gift cards anywhere anytime with Go Wallet On that slip of paper it says current balance is 2150 THAT IS NOT THE BALANCE OF THE CARD I realize there is another reviewer that saw this and believed heshe had been ripped off As soon as I saw the card I went onto starbuckscom to find out that my card had a balance of 25 which is what I purchased It was a bad marketing scheme by Gift Card Mall to place that piece of paper in there But Im pretty sure they could be sued if you paid shipping on the item and they still took off money on the card Its a good item but bad marketing scheme
__label__Positive	Great gift card
__label__Positive	They got it they used it it made them happy to get what they wanted instead of something theyd have to return
__label__Positive	This was to be part of a gift for Christmas but that didnt work out so I will hold onto it for a later gift Thank you
__label__Positive	Dining out is the best  Thanks
__label__Negative	why would anyone pay more than the face value for a gift card your local Kroger brand Grocery has them for face value
__label__Positive	This was a gift and the receiver appreciated it as it is one of their favorite places to have ribs
__label__Positive	I always give Amazaon Gift Cards  through email  I text the person receiving it to let them know to look out for their gift via email

They just add the gift amount to their Amazon account and start shopping
__label__Positive	Awsome
__label__Positive	A gift card to Amazon is always a good gift  I gave out five to family members and they all put them to good use  It came in a cool Christmas gift box which was a plus
__label__Positive	I got this for myself and it arrived in a matter of minutes It also worked on the website
__label__Positive	good price its a gift card not a lot to be said its weird they want you to review a gift card its plastic its attached to cardboard it came in the mail its for the amount they said uh
__label__Positive	FANTASTIC Loved this card it is so cute and I love the matching gift card with it and that you can pick the amount is so helpful
keep in mind your gift message does not get printed on the card you still have to hand write in the card so they know who it is from
__label__Negative	The tin isnt worth a darn Big rectangular hole in the back When people choose the tin instead of the greeting card or just an envelope its because they plan to keep the tin and use it These are absolutely worthless Not even worth the cost of free
__label__Positive	Cute Amazon style box  Great giftwent over well with the Amazon mini box
__label__Positive	just what I expected  Very useful for sending a gift far away
__label__Positive	what I wanted
__label__Positive	Was a gift
__label__Negative	Only idiots buy gift cards for more money than its worth
__label__Positive	I dont trust the US Mail to get a physical gift card to someone or someone not to steal it out of a mail box when its delivered so this is a great option Its instant but they will also delay delivery to someones email until you want it delivered if you order it beforehand As with most things about Amazon this is service is done extremely well Jeff Bezos knows how to keep the customer happy
__label__Positive	Got a 25 gift card for 20 Cant go wrong with that
__label__Positive	These cards are so easy to get and give
__label__Positive	A great gift for the family when folks are at a distance and no one seems to know what they want when asked  A gift card that tends to be used rather than lost
__label__Positive	Hope you have more gift card sales again soon
__label__Positive	My secret Santa loved the gift
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Great gift very convenient
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	The Diamond Plate case is awesome Its a great gift box for guys As always with Amazon super fast shipping 
__label__Positive	as expected
__label__Positive	This is an excellent idea for those hard to buy folks I gave to my husband and he was thrilled with it  Keep up the good ideas Amazon
__label__Positive	I really appreciate Amazon Gift Cards I live very far from my son and can not safely send him gifts and money through the mail  Amazon offers everything one can want  My son loves getting the gift cards and I appreciate how easy and secure it is to send one to him
__label__Positive	Really a cute presentation
__label__Positive	Great to do business with 
__label__Positive	My son loves it
__label__Positive	I love that its so easy to get these cards and buy stuff and honestly you save money using it good deal Love it god bless
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an amazon gift card Its always so handy and the perfect gift Convenient and easy to purchase
__label__Positive	Sent to a family member for Christmas  He was thrilled
__label__Positive	Great Gift
__label__Positive	Great gift card which was used to help pay for a luncheon for my family The card arrived in superior condition and I had not problem using it at the restaurant
__label__Positive	See the card you spend the card Saved me a trip by having them delivered
__label__Positive	Got this card last week and after reading all the negative reviews I was leery of purchasing it  I went to a manager to verify that she knew how to process it  The directions ARE on the print out  I didnt try to scan it from my phone but she said it would work either way  HOWEVER she said many stores can only scan by laying the barcode on the scanner not by using a handheld scanner SOME DEPARTMENTS dont have a scanner and it couldnt be used

Hope that helps some
__label__Positive	What a great idea It worked out great The only thing I had a little problem with was that it showed up on their facebook wall for everyone to see Not a huge deal and Im sure it was in fine print somewhere but I would have preferred it was sent to their fb messaging
__label__Positive	support your local retail stores theyve got it the toughest
__label__Positive	Love the brand of the Teddy Its SSSOOOO soft
__label__Positive	I sent this to a friend of mine as a gift Its convenient because then he could spend it on whatever he wanted on Amazon
__label__Positive	And the gift card is quickly being used on kindle books expanding the mind so thats always good  Will buy again
__label__Positive	simplicity at its best
__label__Positive	Always a good gift

__label__Negative	AMAZON GIFT CARD

__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	kindle gift card online just print and go put the code in the kindle and your all set Fast and easy

__label__Negative	Charged sales tax was already more than cash for a gift card which I didnt mind but tax on a gift cardgeez
__label__Positive	Easy  Turned out so cute
__label__Positive	Arrived on time and will be well used
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt like one of these
__label__Positive	Saved me so much time and money I did not have to sit at Urgent Care and wait forever to see a Doctor when I had a sinus infection I have a high deductible health plan that does not have Copays for Doctor visits so I also saved the 150 fee that I would have had to pay if I went to the doctors office Would highly recommend simply for the convenience
__label__Positive	gift for my wife
__label__Positive	Perfect  
__label__Positive	Gift for a teenager
__label__Positive	And she loved it  Its hard to know what a teen might or might not like  This turned out to be a lucky guess
__label__Positive	Perfect for a spring gift of any kind  One size fits all and its quick and easy  I almost forgot an occasion and was saved by
the email gift certificate
__label__Negative	This and other gift cards purchased on my account were highjacked by professional hackers who fooled me posing as Microsoft Service I reported to Amazon and had to change my Credit Cards Banking and Amazon did nothing to assist me and lost a return I made of three pairs of compression hose that I had purchased and returned  This happened between April 12 and 16th 2017
__label__Positive	Though it would seem a lot of people are talking about having trouble Ive purchased egift cards multiple times from Amazon and have never had any trouble Especially when a good friend of mine lives in another state I purchased this it got emailed to her and boom She was even able to just use it from her phone paperless is a sweet thing I personally recommend them for ease of use

Just be sure that all the information of who you are sending it to is correct and everything should go smoothly
__label__Positive	receiver very pleased

__label__Positive	great for gift
__label__Negative	50 gift card Free shipping  85 WHY

__label__Positive	I saw this on Amazons deal of the day 40 for a 50 gift card What a deal I have a free blooming onion coupon Cant wait to go
__label__Positive	Fulfilled my expectations its the best way to give somebody you love and you are not updated in what she has already got what she wants
__label__Positive	this was a great one and easy to order and quick to receive
__label__Positive	very good and fast thanks
__label__Positive	Love how you add your own picture and message Brilliant emergency gift idea

__label__Positive	Gift cards are convenient versatile and easy to give  Also great for giving when you dont know what buy for someone
__label__Positive	I love the print  color gift card from Amazon I have a toddler to she cant really help pick out a special card for family and friends this gives us the opportunity to not only buy a gift but allows for my daughter to personalize it with her coloring to make it extra special Its a winwin deal
__label__Positive	This was a gift for my mom  She enjoys receiving Amazon gift cards because there are so many choices of what to spend it on  She will continue getting these for many more years
__label__Positive	Receiver of gift was pleased with the choices
__label__Positive	Great for gifts

WD Amazon

Now im just filling in words cause apparently you have to write an essay
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Nice presentation
__label__Positive	Glad I bought this
__label__Positive	This gift card is an appropriate gift for anyone who has the ability to make online purchases  Amazons choices and prices make this gift card the perfect gift for the person who has everything a longdistance friend or relative and for the person whose interests you are unsure  It gives the recipient the opportunity to purchase something that they really want  Great Idea
__label__Positive	Wish there was a way to scan from phone Other than that it worked as instructed

__label__Positive	This was a great way to send money
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	This is my second time purchasing this The only thing is that it does not take 5min More like 5hours
__label__Positive	EVERYONE loves an Amazon gift card Easy to purchase and perfect when you need a gift at  the last moment
__label__Positive	birthday gift gets there in time and they have so many choices on line to buy what they wish for  thank you easy shopping
__label__Positive	Excelent
__label__Positive	This is just what I needed With almost everything available on Amazon this is the best no fuss present as well as the option to personalize it with picture  just loved it
__label__Positive	This is a great gift  There were so many cards to choose from  The process was easy and so fast  I liked that I could print it immediately and not have to wait on the mail to deliver the gift card
__label__Positive	I got this card on a lightning deal for 40 so it was a great value It was the perfect Christmas gift for my sister who loves burgers and Steak n Shake It shipped very quickly with prime shipping too
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	I like that you can get a 3 pack It will be for gifts so I can split them up Very convenient for me
__label__Neutral	I had these plastic cards mailed to me as I was taking them to an occasion as a gift  Who wants to give a gift of a printed at home gift card on piece of paper that will easily get lost  I filled out the Gift Message thinking there would be a little card that went with it with the message on it  Nope  the Gift Message is written on the Packing Slip only  Defeats the whole purpose  Helpful hint  if you are sending these strait to someone be sure to put your name in the FROM area or they will have no idea who they are from  It seems as big as Amazon is theyd have a better system for gift cards  What I expected was this  A gift card with a wedding motif and a message preferably on the gift card or at least a greeting card with the gift card that had my message and who it was from  The ONLY advantage of buying these through Amazon was I got the gift box otherwise you might as well buy at your local grocery store and have the amount spent used towards grocery store points  Very Disappointed

Case

__label__Positive	I use to purchase gift cards at local stores like Best Buy and JoAnn Fabrics  Now they no longer carry them or have such difficulty loading money on them that they dont want to do it  I dont understand why there is such a strained relationship between Amazon and stores but I do know that it affects customers
__label__Positive	Fantastic gift Who doesnt like a gift card The card holder and theme where a hit
__label__Positive	Great card  Cute design easy to fold  Granddaughter liked it
__label__Negative	It did not worked Bought it in November and recently tried to redeem it but Airbnb told me that something is wrong with the card The card fund was not supposed to expired It seems like I wasnt the only one who had this problem If you want to gift airbnb just do it directly on their website
__label__Positive	any time I can get it at 5 off  Im going to get it my only regret is I didnt get multiple of them  I LOVE their sourdough rolls
__label__Positive	Best possible gift to give
__label__Positive	My husband gave me a Kindle Fire for Christimas
My children gave me a kinkle gift card to use for buying books for my kindle
I loved it it made buying books very easy and with the quick one key payphrase I can make the purchase much faster and easier
__label__Positive	It arrived on time and money was not taken from my card until it was sent  Recipient can use these cards to send gifts to friends in US though she lives in another country  Then she uses the money on a gift for herself
__label__Positive	So easy to purchase No need to go in search of these Saved me a ton of time
__label__Positive	A great way to say thank you to professional vendors or to give gifts to friends  Amazon sells everything pragmatic or splurge its all here

__label__Positive	My grandson was surprised and delighted to receive it
__label__Positive	Ordered this ecard gift for my friend who lives in Guatemala  Its expensive to ship things there from the USA but with Amazon ecard gift cards she gets it right away and can buy what she wants  I will absolutely use this method again and again  Love me some Amazon
__label__Positive	Worked well

__label__Positive	Perfect gift for a teenage girl
__label__Positive	Great idea to personalize a gift card
__label__Positive	Everything as expected Thank you
__label__Negative	The item is exactly what I had hoped it would be A gift card in a nice box However it also stated 1 day free shipping I needed my package to arrive the next day it did not I wouldnt have ordered it if I had known it wouldnt arrive on time Two day shipping is OK if it is occasionally 3 day shipping 1 day shipping needs to be 1 DAY SHIPPING

In short if you need a gift card and want in a pretty box I give this 45 stars
If you need a last minute gift dont order this A great gift in the mail isnt a great gift rated 1 star

FYI Amazon does not guarantee 1 day shipping so their is no recourse if your package arrives late
__label__Positive	A fun way to provide a gift voucher  I used it as a present for a child who is at that age when they enjoy having their own money to spend on something they choose  Very successful will definitely use again
__label__Positive	What can you say about gift cards
__label__Positive	I ordered this for my granddaughter at Chanukah but did not have her email address o I tried to email it to her mother which did not work  I have been in Mexico for six months without a printer so I had to buy one for thisand otherpurposes  It did print and I have now sent it on as a birthday present a bit out of season

__label__Positive	ADORABLE
__label__Positive	I like the bear
__label__Positive	These always make great gifts especially when youre lazy and dont want to go to the store to pick one up Email it to someone
__label__Positive	The gift card came in the cute little grad cap box as shown I would have given 5 stars but I paid extra for it to come wrapped or in a gift bag and it came in a regular Amazon box
__label__Positive	When you need a little something to say Thank you or Happy Birthday or Happy Anniversarya package of 10 gift cards to keep on hand is perfect
__label__Positive	These are great The children loved the pop up
__label__Positive	The mini shipping box is so cute  It seems to have a magnet to close  No tape needed  Complete with a smile

__label__Positive	There was such ease in obtaining downloading and printing the gift card Couldnt have been more easy Holiday shopping made easy
__label__Positive	Product as described  Cute and FAST overnight shipping

__label__Positive	Great Idea adds a special touch my nephew really loved seeing his photo on the gift card would do it again
__label__Positive	My stepdaughter says Amazon gift cards are THE Thing to give her children for any occasion  I used to go to great lengths to buy them the best books for their age ranges which was a daunting task at best Now they can buy whatever they want hopefully something Id be happy about though really its more important that THEY be happier than me
It couldnt be easier to buy and send these cards I wonder whether theyre not too impersonal whether we have lost the art of conscious giftgivingof meaningful presents to our beloveds  But then I think of the number of  truly awful presents my relatives used to send me and Im grateful that this option exists now for the next generations It doesnt get much easier than thiswhether its meaningful remains to be seen

__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are a great way to manage the purchase of kindle books I purchase the gift card on my account and can then add it to an account that does not have a credit card attatched to it This is a great way to manage an account for a child or for other accounts that are accessed by someone other than you And it is practically instantaneous Since I dont have to wait I dont forget to finish what I am doing

__label__Positive	I originally wanted an original nice gift card but unfortunately they dont deliver to my County

Luckily a download version is available

Once purchase its instantly available for download Just a matter of printing

__label__Positive	Yes it was great to be able to send this to my son  He used it to purchase a new Kindle

__label__Positive	Im told it worked perfectly  My only comment is that I am from Canada so I purchased a Canadian gift card only to find out later the person I was buying it for to buy books who also lives in Canada has a US account and it was not transferable to the US account since it was a Canadian gift card  Too bad  Had to subsequently buy a US gift card  Couldnt an exchange rate just be applied to the Canadian gift card and then credit the US account
__label__Positive	gift card was great easy to use
__label__Positive	big hit at xmas
__label__Neutral	Gift for a friend they were very happy with the money Although they were disappointed they couldnt reuse the tin for anything

__label__Negative	My mother didnt receive the gift card in her email like I had expected She had to email customer service I was scared that it went into cyberspace
__label__Positive	It was quick easy secure without any problems  I can trust amazon that if there were a problem customer satisfaction is their focus
__label__Positive	Just as adorable as pictured
__label__Negative	I never got the gift card No one has responded to me
__label__Positive	I had no  problem buying the card but afterwords I was told I would get an email with all the information on it to download and print the card I waited three days and never received the email I finally went online to my account and figured out how to download and print The card looked nice and my wife was happy with being able to buy some apps and books To this day I have never received the email telling me how to get my gift card I am fairly computer literate so it was not much of a problem for me to find out how to download but to someone with lesser skills it could be a problem So let the consumer beware

__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Gets there quick and gives them something they can use and I dont have to worry that they will return it
__label__Negative	Purchased this item despite the reviews and received it right away Before I tried to use it I printed it out and  I called Albertsons since they are under the Safeway brand and they told me that they couldnt accept it because they are not linked to Safeways system Advised me to try Vons I called Vons and manager said they can accept it as long as register accepts it I went to Vons and the Manager mentioned that he has seen these before He told me that he would transfer the amount to a Safeway gift card When he scanned the bar code after following the instructions 6 times he said that the card is asking for a value and there is no money on it He said the system is treating it as a new gift card He ended up calling the company that places the money on the card and they told him the value was there but couldnt do nothing more than that He called Safeway customer service and they told him that I would have to call where I purchased it from since they couldnt do anything about it After an hour or so it didnt work in my case I called Amazon who then sent a refund request to Safeway and I got a refund
__label__Positive	very grateful and pleased with you thank you very much for your help
__label__Positive	Amazon saved the day when someone stole the money from my nephews card If you didnt know that you can text a gift certificate now you know It got to him right in the first few minutes for his birthday  never too late to be on time 
__label__Positive	The process of getting the gift card worked perfectly  The recipients had listed several items on Amazon as  gift suggestions but it was much easier to get the Amazon gift card and let them make the decisions
__label__Positive	So easy and so quick
__label__Positive	Very please
__label__Positive	Easy and fast  all in one  I just wasnt able to add a note
__label__Positive	Printed gift card but it was not in color as advertised Amazon gave me a 10 credit because of the software error Otherwise the card was fine
__label__Positive	Great and fast delivery

__label__Positive	Cute packaging and gift was much appreciated by our son Something he could open on Christmas but then buy whatever he wants later
__label__Positive	Product was delivered as stated in advertisement Will use again in the future
__label__Positive	The card is always the perfect gift  The gift card to enclose it in came too bent to use  No great loss but a tad disappointing
__label__Positive	you can never go wrong with an amazon gift card It is full of happy and potential If anyone wants to throw one my way please do

__label__Positive	excelente producto
__label__Positive	This came a day early Couldnt be more happy Easy way to please anyone for any event
__label__Positive	A great place to eat  These gift cards are not found where there are no locations  I have friends who live where they can go to Friendlys  This is the only way I can gift them for special occasions
__label__Positive	Easy to buy To use you must either print or download an app to load the barcode onto
__label__Positive	Nice box
__label__Positive	I love to get Amazon gift cards  It was emailed to me  I clicked on redeem and the gift amount went straight to my Amazon gift card balance  When I placed my order  I was credited the amount during the check out  My goodness it couldnt have been easier  Plus there are more then enough items to choose from  I really liked that they keep your balance until you spend it no matter how long after you redeem it  If you order something and dont want to use it you can easily do that too  I took a while to make up my mind but when I finally did the money was there and with my Prime account I had free shipping on the eligible items which I really liked so all of my gift car was spent on my gift
__label__Positive	Very cute Its a great card holder
__label__Negative	Food not good
__label__Positive	For the girly girls
__label__Positive	
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Negative	Supplied a birthday message for my Mom and when she got the card there was no message just the gift card She had no way of knowing who it was from She asked my sister first if it was from her only to make her feel bad because she had only sent a regular birthday card with no gift At that point my Mom gave up trying to figure out who it was from figuring whoever sent it would eventually ask her if she received it Guess from now on Ill have to rely on the old fashioned way and mail it myself She enjoys Amazon gift cards its a shame Amazon had to make her feel guilty on her birthday
__label__Positive	Super cute cupcake gift card holder
__label__Positive	Great it arrived before Fathers Day
__label__Positive	I noticed that my brother in law had invited me to the Texas Road house when I was in his town  The food was great the service was just better than perfect so I thought I would return the favor and send him a card for him to take friends or family
__label__Positive	Will buy my gift certificates like this for now on
__label__Positive	Great deal  Paid 100 for a 100 gift card and it came with a free external battery charger for my phone  Cant beat that

__label__Positive	Wonderful gift option for any occasion  This one was given for a high school graduation gift  Recipient loved it  Will buy again

__label__Positive	So easy I wasnt able to attend a wedding shower for a dear friends daughter but wanted to send a gift that could be used I attached a gift card saying this is for last minute items that may crop uphope it helps I know weddings get expensive and there are always last minute items to be purchased The cost of those items can pile up quickly This is a great gift idea

__label__Positive	Tasters Choice
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	Super festive pop up Christmas theme Just the box is sturdy and great quality but to have a mini pop up card hiding inside with your gift card is awesome I really cant believe that amazon doesnt charge extra for the box this is such a great deal
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with a Starbucks gift card Especially at the price I paid
__label__Positive	Look great
__label__Positive	love amazon gift cards for a variety of occasions and recipients  like the print at home feature as well as the email delivery option

__label__Positive	will make a pleasant gift for a friend
__label__Positive	Love the Snowflake Tin 
__label__Neutral	Im used to plastic gift cards that can be used to jimmy open improperlyoriented locked doors in peoples homes Since this item is made of quicklymoving positively and negatively charged electrons I found it hard to get a grip on it and even harder to wedge into the space between the two lockset faceplates It was quite good at converting itself into any form of solid state matter of my choosing although after one conversion it seemed to remain set as that item permanently  Also there seemed to be a mass limit on the conversion or something The amazon item listing should be more clear about this but otherwise its a good item
__label__Positive	great home cooked meals
__label__Positive	Always an easy way to give a gift
__label__Positive	I did this and added a picture printed it out and was very quick and easy and was greatly apprectiated
__label__Positive	Awesome way to send out a gift without having to go get a card and then mail itelectronic gift card is the way to goespecially if you have a oops and forgot to get a gift off in time
__label__Positive	This was a Christmas gift for my mother who was trying to expand her iTunes music library  It was delivered ontime and was fullyfunctional when we received it  I was pleased with the both the seller and the product
__label__Positive	Bae loves these Happy Bae  Happy me
__label__Positive	was nice but it didnt fit around the arms very well
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	A perfect gift card for a friend that makes quilts
__label__Positive	Perfect Gift Every time
__label__Positive	such cute packaging
__label__Positive	Gift was well received and enjoyed
__label__Positive	Admittedly the gift boxes for these Amazon gift cards do not look as nice as in the pictures but the gift boxes are free and so is the shipping The same cannot be said of many other retailers and their packaging is on par or less than Amazons If you dont like how they look when they arrive then simply purchase a boxcard that you prefer Not sure how people can knock more than two stars off for a free box
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Beautifully elegant and a great gift to give
__label__Positive	easy way to cover Christmas
__label__Positive	What I expected
__label__Negative	The thing I liked the least was that the tin was empty when I received it No gift card
__label__Positive	Always a good gift Pretty self evident why Enough said
__label__Positive	The gift card was purchased for my son who lives in another state  It was the perfect gift for someone who uses Amazon all the time and for a mother who had no idea of what to buy
__label__Positive	This card was so good it bought me a steak dinner three Tank 7s but did not bail me out of the doghouse when I came home drunk Thanks a lot Applebees card For nothing
__label__Positive	My friend liked the animation
__label__Positive	My daughter was very happy to receive the gift card which came personalized with her and her daughters picture It really made me feel good to give her a gift that she could use as she pleased
__label__Positive	Purchased as a lightening deal for 1875  cant beat that However as another reviewer mentioned it did not come as pictured it was the light green variety and looked as though it was roughly handled or returned a few times because the backing was bent In addition there was a random stickertape stuck to it which needed to be peeled off to look somewhat presentable as a gift for Christmas
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Happy to give this as a gift to my sister
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with an Amazon gift card lovely  festive
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Negative	If I can get a discount when I purchase a box of gift certs then Id consider it otherwise no way Jose Obviously Amazon is getting the benefit of holding my cash as float and making a nice little return while the cards are held by me unused I should be getting something back in return for that privilege This is not the same as American Express with their Travelers Cheques or Gift Cheques which also make money for Amex while they go uncashed since in this case Amazon itself is the one whos the retailer ultimately getting their profit at the time of sale I could abide this for one or two gift certs but not 50 for Petes sake

__label__Positive	Fantastic thankyou
__label__Positive	All good
__label__Positive	Handy and easy to do
__label__Positive	Thankfully it was a quick and easy process to apply the gift card Everything worked smoothly for me
Remember to use the pin and not the serial as the instructions mention
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are never a bad idea I usually buy at least two per holiday season The one day free shipping cant be beat and there are SO many design choices I love the design of the plaid gift card box it really dresses up the gift card and makes it seem a little more personal The quality is outstanding and it even comes with a small note card I like writing in the card myself to make the gift special or to suggest a use for it something I wanted to get but didnt know color size etc Perfect Holiday Gift year after year
__label__Positive	Xmas gift for someone and they loved it
__label__Positive	Great for last minute gifts

__label__Positive	They showed up package in the Box just as picture
__label__Positive	Good deal used right away
__label__Positive	Great Christmas gift  For friends and family
__label__Positive	I chose this rating due to the ease of ordering printing a gift certificate and that
it was holiday specific
__label__Positive	Yes It was ordered for an employee
__label__Positive	Perfect gift idea for the dad who has everything
__label__Positive	This gift card was sent as a birthday  present  for  my mum  brilliant
__label__Positive	Code worked perfectly
__label__Positive	Gift card was available for use within minutes and was very easy to redeem
__label__Positive	Super cute gift tin
__label__Neutral	The gift card was not there when my son tried to use it I had to call Amazon to get it emailed again to him
__label__Positive	Slightly after Christmas gift card Scene was generic and reflective of the time of year issued and not garish Recipient is an amazon fan and reception was positive
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Nothing to complain about
__label__Positive	bought something they wanted This reggae animated card was enjoyed by my grandson  he played it over and over One of the best Ive selected
__label__Positive	My girlfriend absolutely loved this lil guy

__label__Positive	I love the Cheesecake Factory Perfect gift for anyone I am so glad Amazon sells Cheesecake Factory gift cards So convienent
__label__Negative	This card didnt work I gave it as a gift to my inlaws and it never worked Never been used but it came back empty
__label__Positive	Good idea
__label__Positive	Good buy
__label__Positive	Love the email gift card  Provides immediate funds to be applied to any purchase  Great gift for friend or family but also great gift to yourself if you want to partially pay upfront for an otherwise credit purchase
__label__Positive	Cute as can be and got a laugh out of the recipient
__label__Positive	excelente
__label__Positive	Simple but good
__label__Positive	It was convenient to order and print the gift card immediately and from the comfort of my office and  directions were easy to follow
__label__Positive	EXCELLENT VALUE
__label__Positive	Came on time and worked great
__label__Negative	this didnt work through facebookthe code for the gift card was not visible had to resend to my own email get the code for the gift card and give to my granddaughter over the phone  not exactly what i had in mind when sending a gift cardshould have been seamlessly able to use it
__label__Positive	Make great gifts So easy to get and family members love them

__label__Positive	gave to my niece a first time amazon shopper now she is hooked
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	The only thing I didnt like was that it did not print centered on the paper
__label__Positive	useful
__label__Positive	My children live all over the States and Canada and shipping gifts has become WAY too expensive This is the best option for getting them what they want I save gas as Im not running all over town and I also dont have to spend time standing in line at the post office  which really crashed and burned last Christmas when they couldnt get the packages delivered when promised Its a winwin for me I also prefer gift cards for myself as I can select what I want when I want or use them to finance other cards Recycled cash
__label__Positive	Just what we wanted
__label__Positive	The purchase was fast and easy  The recipient had the whole of Amazon to choose a special gift at her leisure
__label__Positive	Easy Gift anyone can use

__label__Positive	Great card Kids loved it
__label__Positive	It was wonderful and the young man who received it loved it
__label__Neutral	Arrived on time
__label__Negative	This purchase was a waste of money it can only be used for one of Spotifys product When contacting support that was useless too
__label__Positive	Gift Cards are always nice
__label__Negative	Card issued had zero balance I initially thought the issue was just an issue on the side of the Panda Express cashier not entering the card correctly Upon check with online balance checker I confirmed that card had zero balance Since significant time had elapsed from when the card was ordered Amazon is unable to help Panda Express is also unwilling to help since card was issued through Amazon
__label__Positive	Love these gift cards

THANK YOU
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with an amazon gift card Can pretty much get anything I want Always happy to get a gift card to amazon
__label__Positive	My son loved this even more
__label__Positive	I had trouble sending all four gift cards in the same order because Amazon said that one of the emails was not valid  I started all over around four times before everything went through typing my sentiment each time  When the ecards arrived to the recipients my name was not listed as the sender and my sentiment did not appear on the email  On one of them one of my daughters who was also a recipient was listed as the sender  No sender was listed on the other three  It could have been something I did wrong but I think it should have prompted me that the sender andor sentiment was missing before they sent it  I dont know what went wrong That said everything worked out because one of the recipients who thought I sent it called me and I verified that I did  I then alerted the three other recipients that I was the sender
__label__Positive	Great way to buy a gift  Didnt even have to drive to the store except for a card  I wrapped it with a set of Lamora makeup brushes from Amazon  lovely 
__label__Positive	Happy Fathers Day gifts for my sons  How can you go wrong

__label__Positive	I found it very easy and convenient to pick my own giftcard and print it out  It was fast and I had the card immediately to give to my son as his Christmas gift  He lives in San Francisco and the cityscape on the card made me think of the Painted Ladies in San Francisco  I would definitely print out another card from Amazon  Joanne S

__label__Positive	When you dont know what else to get an Amazon gift card is the best way to go  My only recommendation to make it better is if the purchaser has prime membership the two day free shipping available to prime members should be able to be included with this gift card that would bring it up to a five review
__label__Positive	Easy way to send a gift
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card is a perfect gift because the recipient can use it to purchase a large variety of items making sure that whatever they choose is right for them  And it is easy to give  just email it to the recipient  no postage necessary and immediate delivery available  Perfect
__label__Positive	amazon has many fun gift card options available this was another guaranteed to bring a smile my granddaughter was quite pleased  i hope it was the card and not just the amount  
__label__Positive	A fast way to send a welcome gift Let the recipient select the gift heshe wants Early or at the last minute Amazon will send the gift on the date you select There is a nice selection of card types It is easy to navigate the website
__label__Positive	This was so easy The person I sent it to got it almost immediately and loved it It is so hard to shop for some people However the amazon gift card allows them to shop for themselves and get what they truly want I will forever do this for my hard to shop for friends and family
__label__Negative	To much trouble no worth the effort POS
__label__Positive	Fast and great
__label__Positive	Awesome Forgot I had to buy for someone 2days before Xmas and it was delivered next dayChristmas Eve It even comes in the cutest gift box and the box was free This way I didnt have to leave the house and I didnt have to buy a box WINWIN

__label__Positive	No problems encountered Trans action was as smooth as silk
__label__Positive	Youll love it after you get it but in the mean time check out rollingbabycom for all your baby stroller info
__label__Positive	It was wonderful to print up the Amazon gift cards right on my computer and slip them into Christmas cards  The colorful choices were a plus over the old black and white a card great idea
__label__Positive	What can I say about this item  It was a free 25 gift card that came free with th epurchase of the Kindle I purchased for my wife as a Mothers Day gift  To be honest the free gift card is what made me purchase the Kindle via Amazoncom versus walking into a store that sells them  It was a nice incentive that worked on me  My wife used up the gift card the day I gave her the Kindle  Its a good idea to get a gift card for the person you are giving teh Kindle to if it is meant as a gift for someone because without titles purchased to place on the Kindle the device is just a nifty electronic thesaurus and dictionary
__label__Negative	I bought this email gift card for Christmas gift for my daughter Well its tricky and deceiving It is emailed to you recipient like an ordinary gift card but it states in the bottom that you muat enter a site which cannot be opened  I tried resending email but it always stated that it was having problems Not very thrilled and convenience is terrible
__label__Positive	Quick and convenient I procrastinated a birthday gift and this was an easy solution it made them so happy
__label__Positive	This makes a great gift for those hard to buy for kids in the family I buy them for nieces and nephews at Christmas
__label__Positive	Great gift for mom Instead of getting flowers that died I got her a amazon gift card that came with a pic of flowers on it she loved it and could buy what she wants I would recommend this
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Gift cards are always a great gift to give
__label__Positive	el producto es de excelente calidad y tal cual lo que esperaba de el Los articulos llegaron a destino en el tiempo justo
__label__Positive	It was a hit
__label__Positive	I bought these for my boyfriends parents for Christmas They love this restaurant Fast Shipping
__label__Positive	This is a god sent since there are avid readers in my family It is so convenient given that none of my family live in the same community or state as myself I never have to have any concern of whether or not I got something my family members will like or want PS Its not just for Birthdays Thank you Amazon
__label__Positive	This was a big hit with my college age grandsons  In fact it was on their with list

__label__Positive	Best way to get something for someone who likes the internet and is hard to buy for Loved how easy it was
__label__Positive	I was fully satisfied  Wonderful gift
__label__Positive	Gift card arrived on time The plaid gift box was an added touch
__label__Positive	My gift card was a family gift intended for a tv for my winter home it worked flawlessly for a purchase and i assume it will work flawlessly for a return should that become necessary
__label__Positive	Just bought a second one of these for a friends birthday I live in the UK so shipping birthday gifts is expensive so a gift card to one of his fave stores is a perfect choice He loved last years and hell love this years just in time for his regular fishing and hunting trips 
__label__Positive	The gift card was for my sister She bought some books from Amazon with it  and so it was a success Thanks
__label__Positive	great for international friendsgreat for international friends
__label__Positive	Its fast easy and there is something for everyone My friends loved getting to browse and choose what they wanted or needed
__label__Positive	An excellent fast and easy way to give gifts  With Amazon the receiver has almost infinite options to choose from  Always a winner
__label__Positive	Very happy
__label__Negative	What happened to Free OneDay Shipping on the gift cards  I needed them in one day  They showed up 3 working days after the day I order them by UPS ground  Had to run to the store to buy some Visa gift cards since I really did need them quickly  Wont be ordering these again if I need them fast
__label__Negative	The Safeway store couldnt scan the gift card from my sons phone  They have to have it printed out  It would be nice if it could have been scanned He wasnt able to use the 25ecard I sent him 
__label__Positive	Easy to use  Great gift for kids to budget entertainment expenses
__label__Positive	I accidentally put the unused 50 card through the shredder and they replaced it within a week  Now that is what I call customer service
__label__Positive	Regal Entertainment gift cards make great gifts
__label__Positive	I love this aluminum case Very classy especially for a guys gift
__label__Positive	I got a gift card for my birthday in this cute little tin along with a gift note I would give it five stars but the tin was sent in a bubble mailer and at some point got a little dented It was not a big deal since I could push the dent out and now it is barely visible I have seen comments on other gift tins about them being dented in the mail and I would have hoped that Amazon would have this sorted out by now

If youre thinking of giving an Amazon gift card worth 50 or more I highly recommend picking one that comes with a cute little tin It really enhances the presentation of the gift card
__label__Positive	Delivered timely my niece was a happy camper
__label__Positive	Much better with no hassles than Walmarts ecards  Highly recommend to gamers

__label__Negative	One of two was missing  
__label__Positive	It made the thank you note and gift card gift givingreceiving experience go from lame to adorbs  They loved it  Great quality little gift box with magnet closure  If I were to be super nitpicky Id ask why the card was upside down in the box  I had to flip them all around  Other than that Id definitely do it again

__label__Positive	Using the printable Amazon gift card was a simple step by step process  Instructions were clear and within a couple of minutes I had made an Amazon gift card for Christmas  
__label__Positive	Greatest way to give an Amazon gift card  Personalized with a picture of your choice  I bought one for my daughter daughterinlaw and granddaughter for Mothers Day  Each with a picture of their children in my granddaughters case baby on it  They LOVED them

__label__Neutral	I did not print the email but attempted to use the egift certificate on my phone The cashier did not want to accept the gift certificate because it was not printed This is a smart phone world so that seems old fashioned as long as the certificate can be scanned  works She eventually acceptes it only because it was for 25

__label__Positive	Fast shipment extremely convenient
__label__Positive	Very nice
__label__Positive	Liked the way it was easy to get a gift card and print it My son and his wife order a lot of things from Amazon They have said the quality if there and a lot cheaper Gave this gift to them for Christmas for our grandson They didnt know you could print a gift card from Amazon
__label__Positive	Easy gift
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Neutral	I ordered 300 in gift cards for my wife and I received 300 in gift cards My only complaint is that each gift card can hold up to 500 yet for whatever reason I was only able to purchase in 50 increments So instead of receiving one gift card with 300 on it I received six gift cards each holding 50
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Easy to purchase and use gift card on your smart phone
__label__Positive	Easy to create your own personalized card
__label__Positive	Its an Amazon giftcard  What else is there to say
__label__Positive	I sent a small gift card to my wife for her to buy a book for her Kindle App Worked out nicely and she managed to get a couple of books for 8
__label__Positive	I ordered these two cards and received a promotional 10 for next purchase which I thought was wonderfuluntil I went to place an order the credit showed up just fine except I noticed an item on my list that i did not want to order just yet so I deleted it  When the order came back up  the promotional credit was gone  I looked every where and did not find itand I did not know how to contact someone to ask how to get it back  All I can do is leave this message and hope someone can correct or figure out what has happened 
__label__Negative	well screwed up my gift cards one didnt evan have any money loaded on it and wouldnt refund the mistakesonly give store creditwould i buy gift cards again from Amazon NO
__label__Positive	A gift card is always great to receive  I can find most anything I would be looking for at Amazon
__label__Positive	Nice container came on time
__label__Neutral	Love subway but I had canceled order but had pushed the order anyways should give a little leadway to costumers on there behalf
__label__Positive	Everything was perfect
__label__Positive	This is a great gift for the person that has everything  Excellent for teens so they can buy what they want instead of receiving something they dont like
__label__Neutral	works well
__label__Negative	Huge disappointment  I ordered gift card on December 20 and it wasnt delivered until two days after Christmas on the 27th
__label__Positive	Not much to say I ordered this as a gift
 The gift card came promptly and is the amount I ordered
__label__Positive	Nice presentation and no charge for the case
__label__Positive	NO COMMENTS NECESSARY
__label__Positive	Thank you AMAZON YOU CAME THROUGH AGAIN YIPPEE  MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS SO HAPPY  She loves F21 store THANK YOU from a very happy customer
__label__Positive	The amazon gift card is easy to buy and to use I like the self print out feature and all the themes
__label__Positive	It delivered fast 
__label__Positive	Quick delivery Just as needed with an online gift card
__label__Positive	Fast and easy gift delivery
__label__Positive	I used the gift card to purchase a Cake Stand and it is lovely
__label__Positive	Great product and price Quick shipping
__label__Positive	Great for a group of gifts  buy a pack give individuals each a gift card Quick shipping
__label__Negative	During the purchase you were allowed to write a message and we spent a very long time writing a personalized message trying to not go over the word count limitation Not to mention we were purchasing a gift card on behalf of several close friends whose names we included in this message When it was delivered the message was not included which made a lot of awkward apologies and clarifications happen because we didnt realize that they didnt know the gift was a group gift and we only found out much later

It seems so simple to just mail a gift card with a message attached to it but Amazon managed to screw it up Really annoying and inconvenient Is this review helpful Probably not but I needed to vent Next time Ill just mail the card to myself and then mail it personally to avoid this hassle Or probably choose a different gift card than an Amazon one
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	Took a chance when I ordered an Aloe Vera plant from California It was inexpensive enough that if it didnt make it I hadnt lost a lot But it did and it traveled a lot of miles through at least some very hot weather and arrived looking good except for a slight tinge of brown on one leaf edge The plant was carefully packed and when we pulled it out of the package the potting soil was moist and the plant had starter size deep green blades and was quite healthy Aloe Vera plants are hard to find every household should have one We set it up on the window sill in the bathroom where it could get indirect light where its cool and a little damp It took off growing immediately We are very happy with it and will most likely order more Aloe pups
__label__Positive	I was pleased with the email gift card I thought when you joined Amazon Prime you received free movies
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Perfectamundo 
__label__Negative	Amazon should consider using less packing material for a Gift Card the card itself can be smaller and well
__label__Positive	The card never expired easy to refill and use There are certainly something youll buy from them down the road
__label__Positive	Arrived on time as expected Gift cards seem to be the perfect gift for the 21st century
__label__Positive	Excellent 
__label__Positive	Very convenient as I can print it at home even at the last minute
__label__Positive	Funny  Cheeky  True  What more could I ask for  I had to send my brother a late Christmas present and this little card with 100 value really said it all 
__label__Positive	Great Christmas gifts
__label__Negative	The gift card was delivered to my nephew with the wrong card so he was really confused when he got a gift from parents he didnt know  There is another gift recipient  out there just as confused to get a gift from an aunt he doesnt know
__label__Positive	Youre welcome Mom
__label__Positive	The gift card is great  I have so many ideas of what I want to buy with it BUT I almost didnt get it  The delivery UPS I think put in under the wheel of my garbage can sitting in my driveway  The only reason I even found it was that I decided the weather was so nice that I was putting garbage from my car inside large garbage can in driveway instead of dropping it in trash can inside the house It rained next day and who knows when I would have seen it
__label__Positive	The grandchild who received this got it on time for Christmas so that is all I could have wanted   I will do this again
__label__Positive	what can be said  giving someone money to spend as they choose it has become the American way
__label__Positive	How do you beat an amazon gift card
__label__Positive	perfect gift for my sisters
__label__Positive	Everyone loves Amazon gift cards  And you can email them right to the recipient so there is no mailing and they get the card to use on line immediately  Whats not to love
__label__Neutral	Great  It did not take too long to get there but we did have an issue with accessing the funds  Highly recommended otherwise
__label__Positive	It was easy to add to my amazon account and automatically deducted the amount from the gift card each time I purchased a book for my Kindle Will keep asking for this as a gift
__label__Positive	Can not beat Amazon gift cards for a present
__label__Positive	This gift card was perfect to allow my granddaughter to select her own bling
__label__Positive	The gift cards are very convenient and certainly is something everyone with a computer can use  I hate it is not as personal as a  regular gift but now a days gift cards save time and allow people to buy what they need or more importantly at least helps pay for something she wants
__label__Positive	Had exactly 50 on the gift card when I went to redeem it I wouldnt worry about the others saying its a scam or they didnt get the full amount 
__label__Positive	Well received gift Always useful
__label__Positive	The gift card that was sent to me was in great quality It came quickly and it was exactly what I expected if not better I recommend getting this if you want to get a gift card
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	My brother and his family were excited to get these They love Starbucks
__label__Positive	The card is more appropriate than a simple foldout which the recipient appreciated
__label__Positive	Great gift for a college student
__label__Positive	I chose this rating because this gift card was the perfect gift  Everything worked out the way it should have and i will definitely do this again in the future
__label__Positive	I like this Thank you gift card This is a great option for a return gift for my child birth day party

__label__Positive	No issues  nicely wrapped
__label__Positive	Great box for a Christmas present
__label__Positive	Nice gift
__label__Positive	It was great to be able to print the gift card for my daughter  I needed to give her some cash to spend on her new Kindle
__label__Negative	Package was opened already inside mailbox
__label__Positive	Just like they said
__label__Positive	When youre not sure what to get someone or you want to give them the freedom to choose their own gift a gift card is perfect
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like an amazon gift card And this one lets you add your own photo Its perfect for anyone on your shopping list
__label__Positive	Awesome Seafood
__label__Positive	Great way to send gifts
__label__Positive	My mother in law loved her gift card and I didnt have to pay shipping or handling or worry about getting her something that she didnt want Great gift to give and so easy
__label__Positive	Easy way to send a bday card Everyone loves Amazon
__label__Negative	For some reason I dont understand this boxed gift card took many days to be delivered and when the recipient tried to use it one of the numbers was lost when the activation tape was removed  They tried to get help over the phone but the customer service rep was much less than helpful  He was non communicative not quite but nearly rude and took a very long time with voiceless poises not explaining what he was doing  On more than one occasion my recipient was unsure if the call had been cut off  Finally after nearly half an hour they were able by trial and error to guess what the missing digit was and activate the money  Is this from a third party selling Amazon cards  We are Prime members so I was amazed that something as simple as a boxed gift card would take many days to arrive  This is very unsatisfactory
__label__Positive	I like that I can send someone a quick Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Amazon is my favorite place to my purchases done  please keep up the great work 
__label__Positive	Instant happiness  It was her birthday and she wanted something on amazon  Easiest birthday gift Ive ever bought Thanks Amazon for making it so easy
__label__Positive	Cupcake tin arrived dented but easy to dent back into shape again Cute graphic
__label__Positive	I sent a couple of these to my son in law for his birthday He absolutely loved them Id taken him there for his birthday while visiting from Australia so now its our tradition
__label__Positive	Easy  convenient

__label__Positive	Great gift for anyone arrived fast
__label__Positive	My Wife loved it and the gift card

__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	My family is at the age when gift cards are the best  Amazon gift cards please everyone on my list
__label__Positive	The best way to shop
__label__Neutral	When I purchased this and other gift cards there was a promotion going that would give me a 5 gift card for items sold by the vender Amazon  The code wasnbsp  I tried copying and pasting it in and typing it in  When I attempted to use that code on several occasions for items sold by Amazon the code was invalid  I tried those purchases before the expiration date of 31 Dec 2009  This was VERY frustrating
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Timely efficient and well received Too easy Amazon
__label__Positive	Perfect gift to give for the holiday
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are a great way to shop  No one ever turns their nose up at them  It is hard to please teen age grand children  They like to make their own choices
__label__Positive	I live in Glasgow and my friend lives in USA so not always easy to arrange last minute gift This was so easy to do and arrived on time
Thank you

__label__Negative	Microsoft limits what you can and cannot purchase with gift cards but the information is completely buried I purchased 380 worth of Microsoft gift cards taking advantage of the 10 cashback award Chase is currently offering for purchases made on Amazon only to find out that hardware is ineligible The link from my gift card balance which states Shop for apps games and more in the Store takes me right to a place I can buy an Xbox One To make matters worse the customer service at Microsoft was subpar at best I should have just purchased the system from Amazon directly in the first place The bundle on the MSFT site is better than the one offered on Amazon but one should stick with companies that offer excellent customer service

__label__Positive	Received this with my 4K Samsung during a sale I mean what can I say its a 100 you can only spend on Amazon Not that its hard to do that anyway Amazon runs deals for refilling it occasionally that might save you 5 or so dollars here and there Would make a great gift for someone who shops online a lot

__label__Positive	Awesome packaging and truly appreciated by the recipient It is a sturdy tin and makes it easy to deliver as a gift And no extra cost for this nice packaging either
__label__Positive	Item came as described
__label__Positive	I loved being able to include a greeting card with the gift card It makes giving a gift card a little more personal Unfortunately you cant include a printed message directly in the greeting card but if you have it shipped to your house first you can provide a handwritten message

My only issue is the false claim for oneday shipping Amazon said that if I ordered is X hours Id receive the card the next day I ordered within that window my confirmation stated the same date yet it didnt actually ship for another 36 hours Once it shipped I had it within one business day but I was extremely disappointed that a simple gift card took 36 hours to get ready for shipment
__label__Positive	Gave this gift card to my daughter for Xmas  She was able to get ALOT of things from here with her 100 gift card  Forever 21 especially the store in the Mall of America is HUGE  This store has it all and most of the stuff is inexpensive but still very nice for teenagers and young adults

__label__Positive	Nice high quality tin to add to a generic gift card
__label__Positive	So cute

__label__Positive	It was a great gift
__label__Positive	My Daughter loved it and if we can make her smile then we did a good thing
Keep these types of gift cards around for us that have kids living in other states
__label__Positive	I love it when someone requests an Amazon gift certificate on their gift list  Its the perfect gift you get to select the amount and the receiver gets to choose something they REALLY want  You can wait until the last minute to purchase too because your gift is just a print away  The only thing better than giving an Amazon gift card is receiving one for yourself
__label__Positive	So every year at my work we have an Easter egg hunt You are probably thinking Say what At your WORK Yes that is right in the middle of the work day my boss declares its Easter egg hunt time So I grab all the Easter eggs I have prepared the night before and hide them all over the place After a few moments the hunt begins and everyone goes crazy like they are 5 years old again After finding all the eggs the one person who finds the most eggs wins the Amazon Gift Card So now you know the back story I can review this product

5 stars of course Who wouldnt want to win a amazon gift card by finding the most Easter eggs Amazon is a great place to shop and you can get anything you want You could even get more chocolate if the contents of the Easter eggs did not fulfill your need Or maybe some upset stomach medicine when you realize you probably shouldnt have ate all those sweets so fast like my boss Ah memories

__label__Positive	thanks
__label__Positive	Umm its a card and you can buy stuff with it
__label__Negative	I wish I wouldve realized before purchasing but this item charged 299 in shipping I had no problem adding the specified amount to my iTunes account but for 299 I couldve went to my local drugstore or Walmart to buy it without paying for shipping Heck its just as easy for me to put it in an envelope and slap a 45 cent stamp on it and ship it and save 255 But the seller had to package it in some fancy envelope with extras that just went in the trash

Buyer bewareyour local store doesnt charge more than the actual gift card amount for iTunes
__label__Positive	i love it I think that amazon gift cards are the perfect gift I can choose what i want to buy

__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	If you pay with the Steak n Shake app and can get these a little cheaper than face value you can really do well They count as regular payment on the app so you still earn credit toward 5 in free product

__label__Positive	Ordered two of these for our 3  year old and 6 year old Granddaughters They had a great time going to the Build  A  Bear store and picking out their animal outfits and accessories The 6 year old settled on a traditional bear while the 3 year old opted for a bunny rabbit with dresses and other accessories It appears that 50 is about the right amount of money to put on the cardyes that seems expensive to me but what do I know about these things Fun gift for the kids when you dont know what to buy them

__label__Positive	The recipient of the gift card was overjoyed because there are so many things one can purchase online at Amazon

__label__Positive	was very appreciated and enables the receiver to be happy about their own Kindle selecton
__label__Positive	Always makes a great gift
__label__Negative	Very bad gift because it arrived used before my recipient opened it  so although I paid 100 for it my recipient was unable to use it
__label__Positive	Product is not as pictured  Got sent a different style of card  I took from the description that the card would be as pictured as they had it labeled as Classic  They are very stuck together and had to take some time removing all the glue  They did arrive quickly
__label__Positive	It worked like a charm in every Whole Foods Ive hoped in
__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	I loved it Its kinda cute and it arrived super fast
__label__Positive	We received a gift card from Amazon for Christmas It was great They have a wide range of products and it shipped out really fast I would love getting more of these
__label__Positive	Is what it is
__label__Positive	perfect gift and a no brainer way to order it  Takes the hassle out of wrapping or finding the perfect card
__label__Positive	Amazon is a great place to shop you can find just about anything for a reasonable price and you can do it all in the comfort of your home
__label__Positive	Good Product i like it
__label__Positive	Giving a gift card from Amazon is always a good thing The recipient gets what they want
__label__Positive	What an excellant way to send a gift to someone special when you cannot get the oppurtunity to see them on their birthday 
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive

__label__Positive	Really the best gift u can give is one of this
Im from Mexico but I have friends and family all over the world

extatic and told me these cards are gold really
Go for it
__label__Positive	Adorable  no extra cost
__label__Positive	Great for post surgery Safe walking on all types of floor surfaces Great gift for anyone
__label__Positive	My Mother in law loves the happy hour eats she was a little giddy when she opened the email
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	This was a simple way to go for me and my friend
It was a flawless transaction  We were both happy
__label__Negative	They want to charge a 195 fee on top of the 25 gift card AND they still charge you the depending on the theater and where you live 175 PER TICKET inconvenience fee The LEAST they could do would be to waive the 195 card fee or not hit you up per ticket when using THEIR card to buy tickets 2 movie tickets at 12 each  24 but add on the 175 fee to EACH ticket and this card is no enough to cover the cost of both tickets PASS
__label__Positive	Wow Cant believe how easy it was to purchase
Great idea Easy in all aspects
Defintly would purchase another one
__label__Positive	Yes it was nice and use full to do this way and its very convenent to send itbecause no mail hassle no run to the
Post office thanks
__label__Positive	I like that it is delivered directly to the incumbent
__label__Positive	Exactly what i wanted  The card itself is just as unattractive as it is in the picture  But hey a deal is a deal  Got it when it was 15 off  I wouldnt ever pay full price
__label__Positive	Christmas present
__label__Positive	Great card  Easy
__label__Positive	This was a great Mothers Day gift One that keeps giving I just love books and reading and would give a gift like this to any reader
__label__Positive	I got given this gift card from my Husband and Darling daughter Miss 3 and Miss 5 for mothers day They know me so well considering I have purchased and read almost 80 books on Kindle since November 2012 I love the Amazon gift cards because they NEVER EXPIRE unlike the vouchers for retail outlets such as Big W I guess an equivalent to walmart and Target Thanks Amazon for thinking outside the box and realising that either way money will be spent through you regardless of how long it takes
__label__Positive	What can I say It always fits and its never returned  My son in law looks forward to receiving the same gift for his birthday each year LOL
__label__Positive	great for online ordering
__label__Positive	Fantastic  However it took quite a few days to get here 4 days  it was from Prime Membership  That part was terrible  Otherwise recepient loved his gift
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong
__label__Positive	Great gift it was perfect for a little boy Easy to use Delivery options were great Ease of use by other party was super
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	PURCHASED OVER 160000  OF THESE IN VARIOUS AMOUNTS  ALL ARRIVED ON TIME AND ACCURATE IN COUNT AND AMOUNT

WELL CONTROLLED PRODUCTION ON PART OF THIS VENDOR  WOULD AND WILL REPEAT FOR FUTURE EVENTS TO USE AS PRIZES
__label__Positive	My son loved it so much  he kept the card

__label__Positive	It is a gift card
__label__Positive	Have not sued yet but Im quiet sure Im going to enjoy it
__label__Positive	what can you say about a gift card  It was the absolute perfect gift for an Amazon shopping fan  Thanks
__label__Positive	The Amazon Gift card  that I sent for Christmas was easily organized and  was received on the correct date It makes an ideal gift for the avid kindle readers in my family
__label__Positive	Easy
__label__Positive	Gift for a friend
__label__Positive	Love the card holder this Year
__label__Positive	Instead of giving presents that nobody wants this is a great way of giving the person a chance to choose their own gift  Easy to order print and send off
__label__Positive	Super easy and super cool for my teen grandsons
__label__Positive	Easy to print and fold Took just a couple of minutes to fullfill
__label__Positive	Pefect 
__label__Negative	Some of these reviews scare me  Think I will get my locally
__label__Positive	It worked perfectly He was able to shop for something that he wanted and would enjoy At 7 yo this is important
__label__Positive	Since the bear is free so I got itreally cute since the hair is too much so you barely can see his eyes
__label__Positive	Found it was a smooth way to please grandson
__label__Positive	Love it Can never go wrong with an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	I bought this for myself as I had some credits from an app I use After reading the negative reviews I was pretty nervous to use this gift card but it worked I had my gift card emailed to me within five minutes and used the gift card with Sephora without issue I cant say how it would work for instore use but using it online gave me no problems
__label__Positive	I love buying gift cards and anything from Amazon because it is sooo user friendly We had choices to pick from I got the Happy Birthday Birds card It gives us the options and in minutes its ready  Personally I CAN be a procrastinator at times and I actually printed this up in about 5 minutes before we had to get to the party  The recipient loved her card she had just gotten a Kindle and together we got her connected  By the way ordering Kindle books is also super easy and instantaneous Great for those of us who sometimes procrastinate when everyone in the book club already has their copy  The only problem we had with giving a 13year old a gift card that she wanted to use on her Kindle was she needed a credit card but it all worked out using her temporary VISA card that she got for her birthday So bottom line we were delighted with the gift card and Kindle
__label__Positive	I found it to be exactly what I wanted  After 48 years of marriage I believe we are very much intertwined
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and was very easy to use in store
__label__Positive	very pleased with the online shopping at Amazon  it was easy and and so much more convenient than going to a store
__label__Positive	Very convenient
__label__Positive	This was a gift to my parents  They both enjoy reading so rather than try to figure out books they might enjoy they both have kindles so I let them decide
__label__Positive	Super Easy to order and they are emailed to the recipient immediately
Will continue to use these
__label__Positive	Always great when I can add a cute animated card  to a gift card
__label__Positive	Very easy and convenient I will definitely go this route again for a gift card
__label__Negative	Was ok
__label__Negative	What a FIASCO  NEVER again  Do not ever buy these cards still wasting time trying to get my money back from a previous purchase and now I get CHARGED  for the 25 that they owe me  My suggestion is to write a check or give cash never an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Im very busy and this is a great way to give a
birthday gift  Amazon has everything  so
my recipient wont have any problem at all
finding something that tickles her fancy  Judy
__label__Positive	Its a pizza gift card folks  it works  YEAH why do I have to review this

__label__Positive	excelent
__label__Positive	The web site is easy to follow and the printout of the gift card is very good Will definitely buy more
__label__Positive	I love that you can send a gift card thru email It is convenient for both parties There were many options to choose from
__label__Positive	My neice loved the Hoop and Yoyo card  I plan on sending it to a friend for her birthday    
__label__Positive	Wow What a great idea A Gift card For to give as a gift I give this idea and card 5 stars

OK sarcasm aside Amazon might want to rethink having reviews for every damn thing on their website Its a gift card  one small step above shoving a couple of 2000s into someones hand and saying Go buy something you like or Tell your Mom I had a great time last night How is this even reviewable For the design Theres a lot of design options and none of them are anything special Sorry creative team someone had to tell you One thing I should point out is across all gift cards purchased in the US an average of 20 of them go unused So in other words if you spend 10000 on a gift card consider it a 2000 gift to Amazon Its not Amazons fault  any retailer would be stupid not to get that kind of crazy easy money Just make sure that the person you give it to is actually going to use it And if you can think of anything else literally anything up to and including cash just give that
__label__Positive	How do you rate a gift card  Hmmmm
__label__Positive	they are gift cards

__label__Positive	This was the only gift that we gave that resulted in all smiles Everyone is a winner when the recipient can choose exactly what they want

__label__Neutral	Nice box
__label__Negative	The card looked as if it were dropped face down on the pavement and rubbed and scratched Dirt was so ground into the card face that I couldnt clean it off  This was for a birthday gift and Im embarrassed to give this nasty dirty thing
__label__Positive	Love
__label__Positive	Gift cards are a practical way of giving if the giver is unsure of the precise item to buy
__label__Positive	Excellent long distance gift
__label__Positive	Awesome gift My sister loved the card
__label__Positive	Serves its purpose and was easy to use at check out
__label__Positive	Easy and fast
__label__Positive	The product and service were great
__label__Negative	Received the very next day which was nice but the packaging was sliced and torn open It came in an oversize bubble manila envelope It appears that UPS sliced the envelope then torn it a bit to check to see if the product was damaged The gift card itself was not harmed but actual Amazon envelope and Kindle greeting card were sliced This was very disappointing since it is a gift I am sad that the deliverer did not report this damaged and have it replaced
__label__Positive	Amazon is my FAVORITE gift card I always have something I want or need to buy from Amazon  Never a disappointment
__label__Positive	I use these for when I receive get prepaid gift cards and the balance doesnt cover the whole purchase It comes right instantly and very easy to use
__label__Positive	Just what we wanted and she loves it
__label__Positive	Printed well easy to use
__label__Positive	Cupcake tin  is super cute
__label__Positive	Gave as a gift to my daughter in law for Christmas
__label__Negative	This CANNOT work on a Family account  THIS IS NOT A GENERAL USE GIFT CARD  This is specifically for a standard Spotify Premium singleuser account   This should be the description of this product  How do I return it

__label__Positive	I love to give these cards as a gift  It means what ever the person you give them to really wants they can get
__label__Negative	Worst present EVER I could not add the gift card and no one from Amazon seemed to be able to help me If I could I would give this a 00 star rating  
__label__Positive	So easy
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	PERFECT
__label__Positive	good gift

__label__Positive	This is a great item from Amazon My stepmother is bed bound with no real ability to get around but she has a Kindle and likes to read My sister and I wanted to give her a birthday present but ran out of time to stop at the store so I suggested we get it online Our stepmothers not very computer literate though so we put the gift card inside her birthday card to make it easier for her to use We bought it at Amazon found a design that matched her birthday card printed it at home and she loved it Saved lots of time and and there was no plastic card to cut up and throw away

__label__Positive	how can you not love an Amazon Gift Card
__label__Positive	The perfect gift for someone that has everything
__label__Positive	Super fast to arrive  Have ordered these before and will continue to order
Everyone loves them
__label__Positive	Amazon is my favorite store so I always enjoy getting the gift cards  I also give them and everyone seems to enjoy receiving them
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are an easy way of expressing thanks  The option to customize the gift card allows the buyer to select the most appropriate design  message  Check out was easy and went smoothly

The customized cards were completed  promptly returned so they could be printed  enclosed with correspondence
__label__Negative	Received an offer through the app for 15 credit when purchasing a 50 gift card  Tried to use the code and had to delete the gift card off the order because they couldnt split a payment for goods and gift cards  Was going to charge the whole thing to my credit card instead of taking the goods off an existing gift card and charge the new gift card to my credit card

Now when I try to get the promotion back its saying that the code has been used for my account and when i contact customer service they claim no knowledge of the offer and directed me to a different 10 for 100 offer

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
__label__Positive	ty

__label__Negative	I ordered a 100 dollar gift card and ended with 2 100 dollar gift cards I canceled the purchase or at least I attempted to Any way I have already deleted the Amazon app from my ipad and I will never do business with Amazon again Not happy and I wont let it happen again
__label__Positive	super gift
__label__Negative	Didnt include my gift options or my gift note He never would have known it was from me if I didnt say anything
__label__Positive	Cool way to present your Amazon gift card to the recipient Small enough to tape to the outside of a gift box which is what I did
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like a gift card to Amazon
__label__Positive	Gift Recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Great way to give a great Birthday gift
__label__Positive	Gift  Recipient happy
__label__Neutral	I was hoping for something other than a piece of paper The card was for my sons graduation from Army MP school

__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	I bought this for my daughterinlaw who is a Prime Amazon customer  She is a dessert caterer and does a lot of ordering for her business AND her family  I knew an Amazon gift card would be greatly appreciated AND used right away  This was one gift card that would not be tossed in a drawer

__label__Positive	Great product

__label__Positive	I got the gift card online created the design I wanted added the words that worked for the event printed it at home and included  it in the envelope with my greeting card  What could be easier  And what could be better for the recipient someone who loves to read
__label__Positive	Sent it to my sis and she loved the pic on the gift card
__label__Positive	It does not get any easier
__label__Negative	Pales in comparison to COMP USA BRING BACK COMP USE WE WANT COMP USA
__label__Positive	Great wonderful

__label__Positive	It worked so thats all that matters I dont trust gift cards from Target or the grocery store because people steal the numbers of the cards and spend the money on the card once you buyactivate it
__label__Positive	This was a satisfying gift very easy to purchase and send  Very appreciated and useful gift  Would send one again
__label__Positive	I printed this gift card along with others  This one was colorful and used lots of printer ink so if youre low on ink colors choose another design  Purchased for a person who just bought a beautiful city home so this was perfect

Gift cards are great for gifts to relatives children who are far away and we do not know what they like need or want If we send them a shirt they might hate it but everyone likes gift cards from Amazon
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with gift cards to Amazon I love the printable ones because you can add a handwritten note for the recipient
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	Wonderful
__label__Positive	Fastest shipping Card was beautiful Thank you
__label__Positive	The card was perfect and my daughter in law loved it
__label__Positive	I love the choices of gift boxes for the gift cards  The only thing that I dont like is that it shows on the back of the boxes that it is from Amazon so therefore it gives the surprise away  My opinion is that that should be hidden inside the box that is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars
__label__Positive	Wedding Shower Gift
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	Dad liked it
__label__Positive	We were reminded of a friends birthday party about an hour before the party we purchased and printed the gift card popped it into an envelope and listened to the teenager squeal with joy Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	I loved it  It was amazing
__label__Positive	great for the kids
__label__Positive	if you are looking to get a guy a amazon gift card This case is really manly My husband loved his
__label__Positive	I got this gift card for myself because gift cards backed by a credit card company normally would charge a monthly fee while this never expires or charges you a fee
__label__Positive	arrived on time  exactly as requested
__label__Positive	I bought tools  Great to have
__label__Positive	Gift card was honored for full amount Very happy
__label__Positive	We love Maggianos and Macaroni Grill  Great food especially at Maggianos where we do a lot of takeout  But Maggianos can get pricey so discounted gift cards really help out

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card When you are buying a gift card for yourself it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20 off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal
__label__Positive	Fine for what it was for
__label__Positive	A extremely reliable product I give them again and again
__label__Positive	Great Birthday gift Received quick and recipient loved all options
__label__Positive	I bought this for a gift for my twin sister for Christmas Cannot wait to give it to them Bought two and its safe to buy so for all of you that read negative reviews know its safe to buy
__label__Neutral	I can get popcorn discounts on my own I buy a special bucket each year  So Id rather just get a dollar for dollar gift card
__label__Positive	The recipient was very pleased as they were planning on making an Amazon purchase
__label__Positive	This was a gift for my son  daughterinlaw to purchase a gift for my granddaughter
The best way to go with me in a different state than they are
__label__Negative	Convenient yet do not try to order product on line with credit card and pay off with gift cards  Lowes will not take gift cards to use on a Lowes account  I received Lowes gift cards for Christmas with the gifters idea that I could use them to buy a big ticket item that was NOT in the store  Wrong  Cannot use Lowes gift card to pay on Lowes credit card account  Ridiculous  It is the same as cash money  Terrible customer service at the store with just one checkout open and a rude associate
__label__Positive	i gave this as a gift the recipient loves it
__label__Positive	Easiest way to get gift cards Cant beat it Pay for gift card and it arrives right at your door within days

__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are awesome  both to give  receive  Perfect for those hardtobuy for people  Ive told my family that anytime theyre in doubt about what to give megive me an Amazon gift card  You cant go wrong

My family likes it because it goes right to their email
__label__Positive	These were really cute
__label__Positive	Beautiful
__label__Positive	Gooood
__label__Positive	This is a great way to give an Amazon gift card  Its more versatel than the Amazon gift cards you buy on a rack from the grocery store because you can include a personal message in it  You can also choose an appropriate picture for the occasion and select the exact dollar amount you want right down to the penny  And its very quick if you need a gift right away you can have it instantly  It helps to have a color printer available and some glossy paper so that it will look its best
__label__Neutral	This is a quick and easy way to take care of a last minute gift Especially when you know it is for an avid reader or someone that uses the many services amazon has to offer
__label__Positive	I use these as birthday gifts for folks that live far from me and I always get a great thanks when people get them in the mail

__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	Cute and different Loved it
__label__Positive	I find the Amazon gift cards very easy to use The only downside is in being able to designate funds be pulled from the gift card for only certain purchases and not for everything you buy It is complicated to make sure that what you buy for others doesnt come out of your own gift card  it can be done but it is sort of a pain However if you dont care and just use oneclick for everything it couldnt be easier
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	This is just a great way to give a gift to kids under the protective eye of the parent at the same time providing a level of autonomy to buy products on line
__label__Positive	Gifted are always a great gift No complaints
__label__Positive	I was so skeptical buying a gift card online The amount was correct when I called lowes to verify and it saved me a trip to the store
__label__Positive	I had it delivered to a friend  I just didnt see a place in the order process that would have alowed me to let her know it was a gift from me I asked her about it after it was delivered and she had no idea who it was from Did I miss something
__label__Positive	Its a gift card  worked great
__label__Positive	Love the discounted cards  Makes excellent gift
__label__Positive	Works perfectly
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with a gift card  Nicely boxed
__label__Positive	It was very easy to select and arrange for this personalized gift card  I was able to send a message and choose the date that I wanted it sent  Amazon informed me before and when the card was sent  No hassles and no worries

__label__Positive	On time and makes a nice gift to give someone
__label__Positive	This is a cute way to present a gift card to a female
__label__Negative	Oversized at a size medium Apparently meant for overweight people Returned product

__label__Positive	The simplicity of matching up the correct remote control from the picture and item number  It showed me where
to look for the corresponding item number
__label__Positive	Funny
__label__Positive	I love giving and receiving gift cards from Amazon They are easy to use and you can find just about anything you want online Fast fast shipping
__label__Positive	I gave this gift certificate to my grandson because I have no idea what to get a 20yr old boy for his birthday I figured I picked the right amount not too little and not too much and he could get something more expensive if he added to it when he ordered As it was he bought some hardware for his computer like the next day
__label__Positive	I love the gift box snd ease of ordering I received it the following day at no extra charge And who doesnt love giving or receiving an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	I always enjoy giving and receiving Amazon gift cards  They are the easy solution to the question What do I give  Especially when the recipient has diverse tastes and Im not sure what they are reading watching or listening to right at the moment

For myself when I get these cards it gives me a lot more flexibility with my budget  something I always appreciate
__label__Positive	Everyone loves this gift  You dont have to worry about returns  They get to pick whatever they want  The perfect gift
__label__Positive	It was brilliant and well received by our grandson

__label__Positive	Its a gift card
__label__Positive	I hope this works or I lost a bunch of money
__label__Positive	Just what my daughter wanted
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	My daughter received an Amazon gift card in a generous amount for Christmas to buy items for her new Kindle Fire she also received for Christmas She had no problem spending the full amount in a matter of minutes I was happy to see she wanted books instead of purchasing apps The only thing I didnt like was it all went onto my credit card because I did not realize you need to enteractivate the gift card prior to purchasing It all worked out okay because I was the lucky winner of a simpler version of Kindle This was the best gift and will others to purchase as a gift for her or myself for birthdays and Christmas
__label__Positive	Like I said in the title A great way to get the holiday shopping done in 20 minutes  I started at about 2020 Christmas Eve and was done before 2100
__label__Positive	not fake gift card came and worked perfectly fine nothing scammy about it
__label__Positive	Nice easy gift for someone who likes Starbuck Coffee
__label__Positive	Came just as expected
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	The card was for a 72 year old friend who I convinced to get a Kindle  She loved the card idea
__label__Positive	Who passed last month  So glad she was able to enjoy the books before she died  Loved to read and her Kindle allowed her to read even as her eyesight was poor
__label__Positive	I bought this again I like the colour of the card and I also like the cupcake tin By using it myself I use the card as a bookmark and my 3year old daughter likes to use the tin for pretending play
__label__Positive	Very cute package and it came right on time
__label__Positive	This was easy and fast Makes a great gift for anyone
__label__Positive	This is a perfect gift for the person who loves to shop online Amazon is just the best My family prefers this gift card to all others
__label__Positive	with all the gift cards I purchased at Amazon we all can enjoy Starbucks drinks thanks amazon for coming on time
__label__Positive	This was great  I didnt have to go to leave my home to get gift cards for the kids and their friends  They came fast too
__label__Positive	Easy to redeem
__label__Positive	ty
__label__Positive	Great item
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	I bought these for family members at Christmas  The containers are very nice  And the gift cards are always appreciated
__label__Positive	Crazy convenient for buying kindle books with points
__label__Positive	I was thrilled with the purchase of the amazon gift card It was easy to do  Easier than I could have imagined The easiest part was that I had the perfect last minute gift for someone and knew that it would be appreciated by them  I would definitely recommend this idea to friends and family and will definitely use this again and again  Hey maybe even for myself  It was quick and efficiently done  My only complaint would be having to make the choice of which picture I wanted on the gift card they offer several choices
__label__Positive	The Santa tin made an ordinary gift certificate into a special gift
__label__Positive	These cards make the perfect gifts for those who live at a distance or prefer to select their own gifts  Amazon offers such a wide selection of items that anyone can find something he or she likes  We received positive comments about the card designs as well as the attractive gift boxes  There was no need to rewrap  Weve purchased these in the past and plan to do so again
__label__Positive	Made the recipient a very happy birthday girl

__label__Positive	gift card  I know what I would buybought as a present
__label__Positive	Very Good 
__label__Positive	yeah
__label__Positive	The Ulta gift card was a Christmas gift for my daughter  She can buy her makeup
__label__Positive	Using Amazon to give a gift card is always easy
__label__Positive	Its a gift card not much to say about that
__label__Positive	I ordered it and it worked perfectly and arrived in literal minutes I was rlly scared bc of of other bad reviews but it worked great for me Idk what problem they could have had tbh it seemed simple enough I did delete the spaces inbetween the card  so idk if that helped Also it didnt look like the card worked on Sephora but once I clicked check out it went right through
__label__Positive	perfect gift card for cat lover
__label__Positive	Are you kidding me
The best gift
__label__Positive	Is a very good product
The product has to inform good friends
__label__Negative	Sent more than one and couldnt add a personal message  perhaps I missed it but it was not easy to see  if it was even available Your system totally sucks should be more user friendly All I want to do is send a simple Birthday gift to my grandson I will take my business to a company that is more friendly  and then you only allow ONE comment on a category thats another of your BS rules
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Was used to get numerous CDs and a book which the receiver truly enjoyed  He got a very unexpected gift

__label__Negative	Made of cheap plastic  Only lasted about a week
__label__Positive	I dont like giving gift cards when a personalized gift is in order but these gift cards are great when something a little more impersonal is acceptable
__label__Positive	Fun
__label__Negative	The product didnt present very well when printed as the design would format for printing This made the gift look tacky
__label__Positive	The card they sent didnt work The Gift Card Number Entered Is Invalid

__label__Positive	What to get for a son who can buy whatever he wants  Give him the Amazon Gift Card and he can shop anywhere  He purchased items we would never have thought to buy him  HE was happy we were ecstatic that we had done a good thing
__label__Positive	Love how quickly I received the gift cards
__label__Positive	This gift card worked perfectly  Ive used lots of gift cards over the years but there is just something about this one that is better
Wait what They want a review for a gift card
__label__Positive	Good product
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	Looks even better in person
__label__Positive	The animation was very cute perfect for my brothers birthday Thank you so much He loved it Thanks again Amazon
__label__Positive	a gift
__label__Positive	Very convenient
__label__Positive	I bought this for an out of town relative because it is extremely easy to purchase and was able to get there even though it was a last minute gift
__label__Negative	Buyers Beware Do not buy on Amazon amazon allows severall acounts with the same debit card even acounts with different names I lost a total of 710 dolars
__label__Positive	The box was very cute and the design adorable
__label__Positive	Funny and such good singers 
__label__Positive	SAved me 5 I think that is awesome
__label__Positive	Delivered when I requested  My grandson had no problem using gift card  Made a great gift for a college student
__label__Positive	Ive used this card once  I took a screen shot of card with my cell phone and cropped it to size to use just like a regular plastic gift card  I just show it when I make a purchase and voila  Payment complete
__label__Positive	It a gift card  It worked as expected and saved me the time of going to a traditional store and buying a similar one
__label__Neutral	I intended giving my son a Kindle Fire for his birthday I bought the Fire and created a seperate account for his Fire I dont want him charging my credit card directly I attached a gift card to the account and then registered the Kindle to that account I verified that everything worked I was able to get free books and free music Then I tried to get the daily free app and recieved an error message saying I needed to have a credit card attached to account to buy apps

Thinking that couldnt be true I contacted Amazon customer support After 45 minutes on the phone they confirmed that you can not purchase Kindle Fire Apps even free ones using a gift card You must have credit card attached to the account to purchase apps

In other words gift cards cant be used like credit cards or cash There are things you cant buy with them on Amazon

Other than this issue Im happy with the Kindle Fire However since apps are one of the key kid features on the Fire I cant help but wonder if it makes sense to gift it to anyone who doesnt have a credit card
__label__Positive	A great gift for all ages
__label__Negative	We purchased these gift cards to hand out as bonuses for our employees  We recently gave one to an employee but when he tried to use the gift card it came up as Unauthorized we found out that this means it was never activated by Amazon before being sent to us  This is incredibly frustrating for him and for us especially given the fact that he called Amazon to get this issue corrected and was put on hold multiple times and then eventually hung up on  The person he was working with basically insinuated he stole the card and there was nothing they could do to rectify the situation  We are still in the process of getting this corrected which is a horrible waste of time considering its for 25  This has been a terrible experience which is unfortunate given Amazon is usually very customer service oriented
__label__Positive	Worked great
__label__Positive	Fantastic
__label__Positive	Great way to send a present
__label__Positive	Gift cards are gift cards but they did arrive very quickly
__label__Positive	Works great Awesome present
__label__Positive	Sent right away great gift
__label__Positive	Sharp looking tin for Christmas gift cards
__label__Positive	Pretty
__label__Negative	I received a card which had no balance on it Southwest confirmed that the card was not activated on Phone but refused to take action and instead ask Amazon to help me out Amazon refused to help too claiming we are a dumb shipping company and not responsible for the stuff we send In the end SWA accepted to look into it if I could mail them the card So if you still planning to buy one be ready to accept the fact that there is no one whom you can claim as liable for the stuff All you can do is pray it has the intended balance on it
__label__Positive	Nice gift option my friend was very happy with my present I would prefer more opportunities to personalize the card
__label__Positive	Love the convenience of the gift card in a genuine Christmas card It arrived right on time just as the schedule said Love the 2 day shipping

__label__Positive	Always love having a gift card from Amazon  Spent mine on several items including music for my ipod  But the best part was my new Kindle Fire cover from Marware  Havent received it yet but looking forward to getting it and trying it out  Love Amazon  Great Customer Service and great products  Usually when I find something I like it gets discontinued  Hope that never happens with Amazon

SR

__label__Positive	My Grands Love their gift cards from Amazon They can get online and pick out what they want and Mom or Dad doesnt have to take them shopping

__label__Positive	Purchased for grandsons birthday  he loved it
__label__Positive	My grandchild loved it 
__label__Positive	I liked that it is very hasslefree to redeem them  some other places are very complicated when you try to use them  There is nothing to dislike about them
__label__Positive	If youre looking for a gift for someone you have no idea what to get for them Amazon giftcards are my personal holiday lifesaver  This year they introduced the packaging of the cards and it looks very professional

The best part about these cards was that I ordered them on a Thursday evening and they were dropped off at my door that Saturday  Talk about speedy delivery

Of course I will continue to use Amazon for my gifts of the unknown
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for those who shop on Amazon Also good for those who you dont have a clue what to get or dont care enough to try 
__label__Positive	Perfect when I need something to get over 35 for free samenext day shipping If you have one of the Amazon Prime credit cards youll effectively get 5 cashback on your Starbucks consumption Nice

Never had any issues with the gift cards either
__label__Positive	What can I say it is a Gift Card for Famous Footwear My wife has a tendency to use her Gift Cards on purchases for our kids instead of herself so maybe she will use this one for herself
__label__Positive	Nice looking box and bow great gift much better than just a plain gift card I love ti
__label__Neutral	I spent a nontrivial amount of time finding a good family picture and then aligning it nicely for the gift card When my mom received it she wanted to know why only two of us were in the picture and not all four

If the picture is not going to be the way I did it then why bother Just get the generic Amazon gift card and save yourself some time and effort
__label__Positive	I ordered 3 in two weeks for birthday presents for out of state grand kids They LOVE to get Amazon gift cards as they can buy almost anything from Amazon

__label__Positive	fast shipping
__label__Positive	So easy Saved the day for last minute Christmas gifts
__label__Positive	Got free with the purchase of a ps4 slim on black friday great deal thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Last min Gift idea They came fast in the mail and there was no issue using them at the store Just as if you had bought them at the store
__label__Positive	Saved 5 dollars How much better could it get
__label__Positive	This made for such an adorable birthday gift for my friend who is an Amazon addict Its so much better than just putting a gift card in a card I was a little concerned at first because I had ordered little Amazon boxes with regular gift cards at the same time and worried that I would not be able to tell the difference definitely would not want to gift a birthday gift card to someone when it is not their birthday but Amazon does all things well and there was a nice cut out on the bottom so I was able to tell which box had what gift card in it by comparing the digits on the order

__label__Positive	Christmas gift for my father He loved it Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	as always a great buy delivered fast

__label__Positive	Beautiful
__label__Negative	Can only be used on the US site  and that site flicks you back to the Aus site   so very frustrating
__label__Positive	Wow this was very easy and super convenient i would absoutely use this feature again my friend use it immeiately and was happy with it
__label__Positive	Money at Amazoncom whats not to love
__label__Positive	Had a great time  People were friendly and made our experience a memorable one
__label__Neutral	This is an excellent presentation for giving a gift card I gave 3 of 5 stars because these should be individually wrapped in some protective layer The snowflake and this ornament tin were shipped together and the ornament tin has an area where something scraped against it  it look pretty crappy
__label__Positive	Easy way to make sure recipient gets what they like The tin is cuter than just giving a gift card Arrived in great condition
__label__Positive	I was surprised that this was next day delivery during the Christmas period I will definitely purchase an Amazon gift card this way again The tag is adorable and the gift card is useful or virtually anyone

__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Used this as a thank you gift for someone who shops Amazon  This is always a great gift like you have this extra cash to find something you wouldnt buy for yourself  The card with the decorative box is a wonderful idea
__label__Positive	Perfect Just what I needed came quick and free shipping
__label__Positive	Perfect Christmas gift
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love a gift card Awesome gift for the last minute shoppers
__label__Positive	This is a great way to give a gift card without having to go anywhere to buy it  The convenience of homeshopping is wonderful  I have both been the giver of an Amazon gift card and the recipient  I highly recommend them for both roles
__label__Negative	This product is not bought to recover the money
I really do not know what to do because the purchase was not made from my user or my registered address
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards make great gifts They are easy to print and easy to use Would recommend to all my friends
__label__Positive	Everyone loves getting a gift card  The gift card holder was fun and attractive
__label__Positive	Quick delivery Gift card as expected

__label__Positive	Fast and easy gift
__label__Positive	Gret easier present
__label__Neutral	The inside is blank  People have NO idea who the card is coming from
__label__Positive	Arrived on
__label__Positive	This was great  Came immediately and we were able to use a coupon code to get the 25 for 20  Excellent
__label__Positive	Great But could see the whole Card on the receiving end
__label__Negative	Fandango screwed up and I lost 45  Dont shop at Christmas time
__label__Positive	The person who received this card was very happy and enjoyed the animationwill definitely buy more animated cards in the future
__label__Positive	I was struggling with what to get my friend for her birthday and for that I was putting off purchasing a gift  I wanted her gift to arrive in the mail on time so I decided to order and print a gift card from the Amazon website and inserted it into her birthday card I liked that you can choose a design that fits the occasion The process was easy and my friend got the card the day of her birthday
__label__Negative	You know it might make sense to wait to request a review until the purchaser actually uses the item purchased  And in this case Amazon can tell I have not yet used this 100 gift card  If I havent used it I can hardly rate it now can I
__label__Positive	Fun for a birthday gift and very well received
__label__Positive	Perfect Bought this because Lowes doesnt do split payments online but they do accept credit cards plus giftcards
__label__Neutral	Bomb

__label__Positive	Is what it is Duh
__label__Positive	When I received the cards they didnt have the personalized message on them I filled it out but nothing No big deal I can fill them out
__label__Positive	I LOVE receiving Amazon gift cards because there are so many fantastic products to choose from  And I dont have to walk around in a lot of storesI sit at my desk and try to figure out which of the many great items I want to spend my gift card on  A great cup of herbal tea and an hour or so later I finally make a decision  Awesome gift  Thank you Amazon for being there as you are
__label__Positive	It was so easy Really simple instructions I definitely will be making this a permanent part of my gift giving  Thanks

__label__Positive	Nice to have cards onhand without shelling out the gift amount
__label__Positive	Its a gift cardnot much else to say here
__label__Positive	What an easy peasy gift to send
__label__Positive	The perfect gift for the man who buys anything he wantswith the partner who throws out anything she deems as surplus He loved it She loved it I personalised it Win win win
__label__Negative	 Right now gift cards can only be redeemed by US residents with a USbased payment method You can add a US payment method and update your country of residence in Account Settings Not able to redeem This is the message lol

__label__Positive	The case is a very pretty snowflake design but its bigger than I anticipated
__label__Positive	The top reviews are one star which made me hesitant to get it at first After I sorted the reviews by Most Recent it seemed that the Sephora email gift card has been working for most people lately so I gave it shot I prayed to the gift card gods that my gift card would be emailed in a timely manner and fully function My prayers got answered I received it in less than 5 minutes and was able to use the full value without any issues

__label__Positive	Gift card works great  Who doesnt like Steak n Shake  Only problem is sometimes the employee behind the counter has issues manually entering it in because they dont use a four digit code for the expiration date  For example 0517 for May 2017  No blame placed on the gift card though

__label__Positive	I have given so many of these cards that I have lost count  Everyone that received this card from me loved it and had no problems with their purchases on Amazoncom  The fact you could somewhat specialize your card front the gift box and the oneday shipping were added pluses  This allows people to avoid fighting horrible traffic and getting it delivered right to their front door  the card and their purchases

__label__Positive	Just love the cupcake tin  I know all my grandkids enjoy shopping on Amazon  PLUS next day delivery Awesome customer service
__label__Positive	Fun gift cards to keep on hand for special occasions
__label__Positive	I purchased this for a high school friends 70th birthday thus 70 card  I had never done that before but the process was easy and she confirmed by email that she received it in addition to the receipt I got from Amazon  I was a little nervous about the process but it all worked out from Seattle to Texas  I would do it again because its easy  The most important thing is that the transaction is accurate and that the gift arrives on time at the right place for the right person

__label__Negative	The card arrived to my sister unsigned so she had no idea who sent it  Amazon should have at least included the name of who sent the gift card  I called her several days later and she had no idea who had sent this card
__label__Positive	This was an easy nice gift to give for a friends wedding I liked that I could customize the card and print it at my own convenience

__label__Positive	A lovely surprise for my friend
__label__Positive	quick and easy
a perfect last minute gift
__label__Positive	I love how simple and easy it is to purchase amazon gift cards You get get whatever you want on amazon

__label__Positive	What
__label__Positive	Well its is very fast and reliable If you want to give a gift to someone and dont know what to give this is perfect
__label__Negative	WARNING  DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE USING A GIFT CARD IN LIEU OF A CREDIT CARD  Wish I had read reviews first I bought one of these for my son to use because I refuse to post credit card info onto his Windows Store account duh  leave a credit card on file for a 13 yr old I wanted him to be able to buy some apps  Since the product info said use this for app purchases it only made sense just like buying an amazon gift card The difference is that amazon cards work for payment and this doesnt It now appears that the Microsoft account info for windows store REQUIRES a credit card and leaves no option available for gift card use only And then MSs ultrahelpful chat folks could only come up with maybe you should try to get in touch with the account and billing dept Not even a let me switch you over to them I may as well have thrown the 25 out the window

__label__Positive	great job
__label__Positive	Purchasing this gift card couldnt have been easier  I highly recommend doing it this way  I had it sent directly to his email so he could use it immediately  But I like how it gives you options to also print it out or have it sent to you

__label__Positive	Received my order on time Very pleased
__label__Positive	perfect gift for teens
__label__Positive	Delivered in minutes and recipient spent at leisure without any problem
__label__Positive	Great Fast
__label__Positive	The card was a gift to a relative on the occasion of her having her second child they loved it since they buy
from Amazon regularly so it was highly timely
__label__Positive	IT WAS A HIT
__label__Positive	Its money to be used with Amazon  Other than supporting the growing monopoly how can you go wrong with money
__label__Negative	This made getting someone a great gift very easy
__label__Negative	LIARS If you dont print it you cant use it Whats the point to call it EGift Card
__label__Negative	I purchased 2 gift cards for Ruths Chris Steak House but apparently Amazon doesnt carry RC Gift Cards so they substituted an Amazon gift card instead  When I realized what happened I cancelled mine but Amazon also blocked my sons card  His card shows a balance of 250 but Amazon said it is blocked Now Im out 500his card and the new card I had to buy to replace it
DD
__label__Negative	It failed to arrive and I had to send it again I am still unsure as to whether the card was included second time around My Granddaughter was understandibly dissapointed

__label__Positive	Fast delivery as always
Kids loved them
__label__Negative	Both of my cards had a balance of 0 Sounds like the same thing happened to another reviewer as well And of course they dont accept returns this must be a scam
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly You buy it and print out a code and just bring it up to the register after you are done eating or purchasing something from the store They scanput in the codes and take off the amount If you have any amount left on it you can reuse the paper or just print a new one from amazon with the same code Hassle free took 5 minutes to deliver to my email

__label__Positive	I realized I forgot to get my nephew a gift for his birthday so the day we were to meet with his family for dinner I rushed to the computer to print him out a giftcard I LOVED the feature where you could add your own photo to the card He is obsessed with Minecraft so I put an image of that on the card Imagine our surprise when after opening his birthday card he couldnt stop staring at the Minecraft image lol We ended up getting him the best gift even though we initially forgot Score one for us
__label__Positive	These little boxes were so cute
__label__Positive	would like to have the plastic card option too

__label__Positive	I enjoy giving Amazon gift cardsboth print and electronicto family and friends  They are very easy to use there are lots of designs to from which choose and even more items for which to use the cards
__label__Positive	Fine
__label__Negative	I use this because everyone in my family likes gift cards I ordered one for Fathers Day with a cute design  When it was emailed to me it was only the boring A for Amazon design that would print  I gave 2 stars because they sent it quick but I didnt have time to contact customer service to get the right card their system should work better than that  Plus it made me put in my credit card number about 3 times to receive it what a pain  Something glitchy there
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	Email card quick way for a fast gift
__label__Positive	This was also a gift for my son he has  a kindle and he liked this gift It is a gift that can be used for anything
__label__Positive	Recipient received the E gift card instantly  Very nice option for gift giving
__label__Positive	It is a very quick and easy way to let people know that you are thinking of them on special days  I just wish it also gave that personal feel like when you receive a card in the mail  Dont get me wrong I really like this although it seems to be missing that personal touch
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	I LOVE getting a Amazoncom gift card  Amazon has everything someplace in it to buy CDs books pet stuff kid stuff toys etcnever goes to waste
__label__Neutral	The gift card was exactly the amount I ordered and came on time I had no problem with the card My problem was with the gift box it came in I specifically chose a nice gift box per this gift card was for a gift However when it was received the box was dented  could not be fixed I had to give the gift card in a dented box Its not the end of the world but if I pay good money for something I usually expect it to be in good condition when I receive it  The idea of having certain dollar amounts on gift cards be available in a nice gift box is a great idea but I would caution those who order it to be aware that it might be in less than perfect condition when it arrives
__label__Positive	I needed a quick last minute gift and this was filled the bill I was able to download it and print it out in minutes The recipient was please because you can order just about anything on Amazon
__label__Neutral	it took a long time until i received the email enabling me to print a few hours
__label__Positive	Easy to use and NO FEES
__label__Positive	Because it has such flexibility He uses it for so many different things from books to stamps Great gift item
__label__Positive	Gift
__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Very Happy THANKS A
__label__Positive	Great gift ideas
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	The Amazon Gift Card is an excellent gift for anyone but as a book lover and Kindle owner I was thrilled to get such an appropriate gift from my family  Whenever I find a book that I would like to read I go straight to Amazon and order it delivered wirelessly to my Kindle  Within a minute or two Im reading the book of my choice thanks to the generosity of my family
__label__Positive	What can I say  Its an electronic gift card
__label__Positive	Easist shower gift Ive ever bought  It was just what the new Mother wanted obviously an Amazon shopper herself  Great experience

__label__Positive	Husband was very happy with this item
__label__Positive	GIFT
__label__Positive	My clients love Amazon Gift cards
__label__Negative	I learned my lesson Will never order a egift card from Amazon again Placed the order and had trouble redeeming the voucher Forgot all about it like many of us do with gift cards and some how the card was redeemed and used up in Northern California 393 miles away I except partial responsibility for not acting in a reasonable time to get the issue resolved but how did the person who used the egift card get a hold of it Neither my email or account was compromised in any way All I could do was notify Amazon and Panda Express and have them write up an incident report No refund or compensation If your thinking of ordering a gift card make sure you get the plastic card mailed out to you
__label__Positive	Not much to say gift card is as good as cash
__label__Positive	very nicely packaged for a gift and doesnt cost more
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	its a gift card
__label__Positive	Cutest gift card I have ever given This was such a hit at my friends birthday dinner I even want one for Christmas now It comes wrapped in plastic so you have to open the plastic to reveal the box Came as advertised and I would definitely buy again
__label__Positive	Nice one
__label__Positive	Very nice presentation
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Easy purchase that arrive to my relative right after it sent it Great because its electronic and you can set your own amount right down to the penny and it can be personalized to your liking
__label__Positive	Easy to buy online
__label__Positive	Kind of a cool package for a gift card compared to normal gift card envelopes
__label__Positive	Its was a redeemed points
__label__Positive	Great idea
__label__Positive	excelente producto
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	Its a gift
__label__Positive	The cards are fine and convenient  I did about 15 email gift cards in the last two days  For each I had to enter my credit card number 2 or 3 times before it would take  This strained both my patience and my interest in coming back next time
__label__Negative	My cute little cap gift box was missing its tassel  
__label__Positive	If you dont know what to get sombody just get them this My sisters loved this because they just bought clothes

__label__Positive	My review of this gift card is that it is indeed a gift card  As such it can be used by the recipient to purchase products through Amazoncom  What more do you need to know  Seems pretty silly for Amazon to request my review of it but they did  So there it is
__label__Positive	My mother doesnt like placing her information on the internet so this is convenient for her and I when she wants to purchase shows or games for her kindle I think it would be nice if I received a discount for purchase of so many amazon gift cards Otherwise very useful especially since actual gift cards get lost so easily
__label__Positive	Nice card
__label__Positive	The truth is the teenager needed deodorant conditioner new razors etc But thats not always a welcomed gift from auntie At the same time I had a slim hope that she would somehow decide to buy those things she needed instead of getting energy shots and licorice Hence the printable Amazon gift card She still had something to unwrap for under the tree She still experienced the excitement of imagining what she could use the money on I still had hope she would be sensible with her money 2 out of 3 aint bad
__label__Positive	The Snowflake Tin escalated this from a good gift to a great one Creative presentation packaging
__label__Positive	Love the luggage tag holder design perfect to use for all  occasions
__label__Positive	Great option for gifts

__label__Positive	I printed this gift card and placed it in a birthday card for a friend who was thrilled to receive it  Its a great way to give someone a gift when they have a Kindle
__label__Positive	love the ease and simplicity of ordering an amazon gift card especially the great selection of cards  A true onesizefitsall  gift and the ordering process could be better
__label__Positive	Living so far from family it becomes expensive to post parcels Using Amazoncom makes gift giving from a far so easy  The gift card was a wonderful option for a family member a little more difficult to buy for  I would recommend a gift card for anyone  the card was emailed to the recipient

So could a satisfactory shopping
The gift card will be very good
__label__Positive	Very easy to make and easy to customize It was wonderful and a great gift and would recommend to anyone
__label__Negative	This ad used to say 5 minute email delivery but now it takes up to four hours to process Even the slowest websites will deliver within 1 hour Why on earth would I wait four hours for a simple email delivery that used to advertise and send within 5 minutes I have ordered dozens of these over the past year I am going to miss out on a 40 percent sale on a game I play in other words 20 dollars This purchase was pretty much useless and a waste of time I am well over an hour and I will have not received my card

__label__Positive	This gift card little movie is magical  I highly recommend it
__label__Negative	Extremely disappointed  I purchased the AMC  card for 10000  I got the card the next day without an activation code  I got on line to check the balance on the card and the amount on the card was 000  So I paid10000 for a card that had 0 money on it
__label__Positive	Extremely convienient for the last minute shopper like me  It printed very easily and saved me time gas and the hassle of going out to get it from the mall
__label__Negative	BUYER BEWARE THE AMAZON CARDS WERE UNREDEEMABLE AND AMAZON WOULD NOT STAND BY THE PRODUCT Gave a bunch of these as holiday gifts and had several left over When I went to use them 2 of 3 DID NOT WORK Feels highly unlikely that the rest did work so its super embarrassing that our gift to teachers and colleagues in hospital were worthless cards When we called we got as many different answers as people we spoke to card refunded card replacedbut when pushed on it agents noted that they werent replaced or refunded which we already knew because we didnt receive them WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GIFT CARD FROM AMAZON AGAIN AND CAUTION YOU TO ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK At the very least circle back and make sure your recipients are able to redeem cards
__label__Positive	This is the easiest way to go when purchasing for a wedding where you dont really know the individuals getting married or if you know that other items on their registry are way out of your price range This way they can combine gift cards and purchase something they want or need and without any hassles whatsoever
__label__Positive	Was awesome

__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Good quick BDay presents
__label__Positive	This was cute for my sons wedding It was worth the purchase but will bend easily if youre not gentle with it Still worth the cost
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Negative	Purchased this wanting to apply it to prime for gift  In fact it came up in Amazon search as option  Gift cards cannot be used for prime  Im feeling ripped off
__label__Positive	Hey this was a great gift for someone who was having a baby and I didnt know what they needed  Perfect they could pick out whatever they didnt get but wanted for their baby

__label__Positive	always love a gift card
__label__Positive	I admit these GCs are quite a hassle to apply to your account Airbnb seems to have failed to take into account that people are spending large amounts of money on their site and with a GC limit of 100 on Amazon and 250 directly from their site will be purchasing numerous GCs

I purchased 8 emailed GCs from Amazon 7 for 100 and 1 for 50 I added the first two without a problem by signing into Airbnb  going to the icon of my face in the top right corner  account settings  payment methods  and adding the GC code under Airbnb Giftcard

After the first two I ran into a random error sorry I dont remember exactly what the error was This error was remedied by clearing my cookies or using an incognito window I added 3 more GCs using this method before I ran into ANOTHER error Unable to perform action Please try again later or contact support if you need immediate assistance

At this point I contacted support a hassle in itself but hopefully with this info you wont have to attempt it and support replied that only FIVE cards could be added in a day I waited 24 hours and was able to add the last 3 cards without a problem

So again its annoying and its a hassle but I was able to add all 8 GCs to my Airbnb account Another thing to note is GCs can only be used on stays of 27 days or fewer I hope this helps

__label__Positive	Great gift  Just remember to present your spa gift card before receiving your services so that the spa can process the gift card without any issues
__label__Positive	It is easy and my niece appreciates it
__label__Positive	The tin was very nice and loved all the choices The recipient also liked the tin that her gift card came in

__label__Positive	I really like the metal cupcake tin that was free with a 50 gift card I bought  Perfect for a birthday gift  Would work for either sex although I gave it to a female  I will definitely order the free tins when ordering gift cards for birthday gifts in the future
__label__Positive	I almost didnt order two gift cards after readng the customer reviews  I took a chance and ordered 2  One Aero and one Claires  Well I never receiced them  HOWEVER I did contact the company and they gladly replaced them  The customer service agent was very friendly and provided prompt service  One suggestion to Amazon and I have been a customer for 12 years is they should provide a phone number of the companies they are selling for  I went through the proper Amazon channels to report a problem which is through email  Then I decided to google the company and call them myself based on information from their site  I have had to do this twice  Amazon wants you to email the companies when you have some difficulty with an order but as we know that process can be slow when items are time sensitive  Picking up the phone and calling is much faster  Just have your Amazon order number and Whalah  You have the answers and service you need
__label__Positive	Purchased this gift card for my brother in KS  He will like to use it and eat out as he is a single guy  Could have purchased this at a grocery store where we live but did through Amazon so I would have 49 along wother purchases to get the free shipping which to me is a good way to shop  I dont like paying shipping fees  Sometimes they are more than the item I am buying especially wsome catalog orders

__label__Positive	Good quick gift Fast delivery Thanks
__label__Positive	great stuff
__label__Positive	I enjoy using the Amazon Printable Gift Card because I dont know anymore what my grandkids like or want as gifts They dont live close to me any more I know they will be able to find something on Amazon that will please them  It  is easier and less crass than writing a check for me and them They can order right on their computer as soon as they receive it Thanks Amazon

__label__Negative	I purchased the card to give to my parents for Christmas so they could buy books on their new Kindle They are fluent with redeeming gift cards etc but this one is different  It seems to require  the most convoluted poorly explained process Ive ever seen  to use it to get Kindle books they use the Australian site  we still havent worked it out
__label__Positive	Pizza For a moment I gave one star then I realized I was rating the gift card purchase not the pizza
__label__Positive	cute and light and very fast delivery
__label__Positive	Sometimes I buy these cards and get pizza because that is what you do with a gift card to a pizza place

__label__Positive	Nice Thank you
__label__Positive	No fuss Bought this gift card for myself and received in less than ten minutes Had no problem using when ordering online
__label__Positive	Nice one
__label__Negative	I opened up my package and see the plastic that had the gift card in it was already opened by someone The card was ripped off the paper and it was bent Now I dont know if this card was used already This is ridiculous and disgusting
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Neutral	Was scared since I couldnt upload two card purchases but apparently per searches in the reviews only 1 gift card upload per 24 hours
__label__Positive	So easy and so appreciated Great way to take care of birthdays I cant think of a better gift for people who live far away

__label__Positive	Makes a great gift for people and no surcharge
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are easy and seem to be always appreciated they offer different cards to use for the appropriate occasion  I can send them or print them out and have used them numerous times with no problems
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Negative	Did not work
__label__Positive	Adding my own picture made the gift card extra special

__label__Positive	I buy these gift cards to have them for future use and not mess with my budget  I also give them to kids so they can decide what they want to buy for their Kindle Fire

__label__Positive	These are always appreciated
__label__Positive	easy gift

__label__Positive	Great Christmas giftbrought a big smile

__label__Negative	Let me be clear I love how instant these are Came in real handy when I needed them But I will be reaching out to Safeway corporate to let them know that since they sell digital gift cards their stores should have the equipment to accept them 3 Safeways in my area wouldnt accept them And I dont mean that the staff wouldntbut the systems wouldnt I stayed in a store for 2 hours attempting to get this thing to work After the purchase of the card I wasnt really given an option to print the certificate however this was the only way 1 out of the 3 stores could accept it The other 2 stores registers declined it as a gift card and I had to leave the store embarrassed and empty handed Find a way to print it Do not go in to the store with Google pay or Apple Pay trying to pay for stuff If they have the most up to date software beep ngo will work
__label__Positive	So easy  much appreciated
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for a teenager  My grandson bought additional apts and was quite pleased with the card  Will use this type of gift again
__label__Positive	You get out of it what you put in
__label__Positive	Arrived as advertised with one day shipping It came packaged well and the tin looks nice and is great for giving as a gift
__label__Positive	Very nice kids loved itwill recommend it
__label__Negative	I gave this to my niece for a Christmas present  The gift tin comes wrapped in plastic  My niece  having trouble opening it from the front flipped it over  There is a little window opening where she tried to break the plastic seal  She ran her fingernail along the window edge  All we saw next was a horrific amount of blood  She had severely sliced the tip of her finger  There was no stopping the bloodflow  We rushed to the Emergency Room for 5 stitches  Very upsetting  Please help

__label__Positive	What could be easier for a person out of town
__label__Positive	Love to get this gift card for relatives and friends  Who cant find something tasty at Starbucks and its fun to pop in there to treat yourself during the day  Your relatives and friends will think of you each time they use the card  Good to remind them to register the card with Starbucks in case it gets lost  I got this for my mail lady as a thank you for bringing all of those Amazon boxes up to the door in the winter and rain  Its a great gift to send to a loved one
__label__Positive	Worked our wonderfuly

__label__Positive	Easy to use and quickly delivered  Exactly what we wanted
__label__Positive	I like coloring so it was cool to be able decorate it myself but still make it worth a great gift and not just a drawing I colored
__label__Positive	Be aware that certain countries have different Amazon stores and a gift card from Amazoncom does not simply work in all of them My son lives in Japan and they have a separate amazon japan At first I didnt realize I needed to purchase the gift card from amazon japan When he told me it wouldnt work there I read other reviews about other very distraught buyers that had a rather hard time and still were unable to change the purchase Fortunately he was able to make an exchange through family members only
__label__Positive	Very nice card

__label__Negative	I thought I was doing great by ordering this 5000 Gift Card but it came loose from the adhesive and I have yet to find it  Can I cancel the card and get it  replaced  It was a Christmas gift to my inlaws  I am so sick about it and have looked everywhere but am afraid it stuck to some other paper and it was accidently tossed into the trash can
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	great and easy to buy
__label__Positive	worked perfectly
__label__Positive	The gift cards are one of the best inventions to make purchases without much hassle And the process to acquire is very simple
__label__Negative	I ordered this for a friend  The package was left at their front door at an apartment  Somebody swiped it  My friend didnt get a gift and there is no way that Amazon can cancel the gift card and have it shipped in a more secure method Serial numbers

__label__Negative	DO NOT buy Netflix Gift Card Its not the same as regular payment

I have been a Netflix user for a long time and I would buy gift cards for myself at times since I thought its the same as credit card payment anyways However I did not realize there is one big disappointing surprise of using these gift cards

What happened is that I will be traveling abroad for a few months and was hoping to put my account on hold in the meanwhile and will resume my membership after I come back However I was told that the only way to put my account on hold is to cancel my membership and reactivate when I come back However when I clicked the cancel membership button I was told that my membership will only be canceled after all of my credit are used up I still have more than 48 dollars of credit from previous gift card purchase and having my accounting charged for the next 4 months completely defeats the purpose of canceling my account which is to put it on temporarily hold without getting charged

I called the help center and the lady told me there is no way to put my account on hold without getting charged since I have purchased gift cards I told her it makes no sense as it seems I am being punished for predepositing money at Netflix by using giftcards which she agreed she then said shell talk to her team to see if they can help To my big surprise after being put on hold for 10 minutes instead of helping with a solution she came back reading a bunch of terms and agreements that I agreed when I sign up essentially saying this is what you agreed to even though I agree it makes no sense but were legally protected

anyways really frustrating experience one thing for sure is that I will not being resuming my membership after my credit runs out

Just want to share my horrible experience of using Netflix giftcards so please be aware

Thanks
__label__Positive	Buying for my three children and their spouses has become more difficult every year  buying a gift card on Amazon solved the problem and I was finished shopping in five minutes  Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Always a great gift for those people that you dont know what to get  In this case it worked wonderfully because a friend had seen an item I purchased from Amazon and wanted one also  She is in the process of moving so wasnt sure what to get her  She was thrilled and so am I
__label__Positive	no surprise
__label__Positive	Very cute tin for a gift card for the holidays
__label__Positive	I have limited mobility so I always order gift cards for my family I loved the box they came in It was so cute and very conversational
__label__Positive	Great value

Great fun and easy to purchase with immediate use
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like Amazon gift cards
__label__Positive	Delivered on time and as advertised
__label__Positive	My children love Starbucks lattes They cant afford them on their budget so it made an excellent gift for my daughter
__label__Positive	4 stars because you get a paper card mailed to you with a code on it  Why they call this a digital gift card I have no idea  I wanted it immediately which digital implies but instead had to wait a couple of days for a code to come in via snail mail they could have simply supplied me over email or in app  Kind of stupid
__label__Positive	I received the product fast and as espected No problems with it at all 100 recommended Would definitely buy again
__label__Positive	Always a great gift So much to use it for on Amazons site Perfect giftbox
__label__Positive	Easy way to gift

__label__Positive	ADOREABLE
__label__Positive	Great quick delivery and no issues redeeming it with my iphone
__label__Positive	This was a gift
__label__Negative	Was for my daughter away at school Was not able to use Called Airbnb they couldnt help me said to call amazon Out 50  Airbnb did give me a 25 credit good for 1 yr for the trouble they didnt even cause

__label__Positive	Excellent last minute gift

Would recommend this to anyone

Easy fast and mutually satisfying

Better than left over cold pizza
__label__Positive	Arrived as expected Ease of ordering was great
__label__Negative	came in plenty of time However the inside of the pop ups was torn
__label__Positive	Just as described and will purchase from again 
__label__Positive	I had no problemshowever I took notice to all of the complaints people had at the gas station and when I arrived at Safeway I made a B line to the actual store bought an avocado and eggs and went to the service desk then asked the cashier to convert the leftover into a physical gift card so I could use it at the gas station She then told me she absolutely would because she keeps telling the people at the gas station how to process the printed out gift card and they continue to not listen and cant assist the customer So I would advise you to do as I did The other reviewers appear to not have been exaggerating Be safe and plan ahead to avoid frustration
__label__Positive	when in doubt send an amazon gift card and very nice feature that allows you to personalize it with a photo
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	I love these little gift cards and the boxes They have a transparent screen on one side and the box flaps themselves are cool because there are magnets in between the cardboard material to keep the box closed I ordered 3 of these for my roommates and one of them mentioned how impressed he was with the magnetic box flaps The only way this could possibly get better would be if I could put a To and From in the form of a mini shipping label on the box  Id even pay extra for that These are a cute gift card packaging idea though
__label__Negative	Gave to my daughter for Christmas When we tried to redeem it it said 000 remaining on card
__label__Positive	I use this product regularly to make an offer to friends or even to pay services It work great is flexible and delievers a good value to whoever receives it
__label__Positive	Was looking for something for a teen girl and this was the best that I could do since she likes animals
__label__Positive	Sister in law is in college in Minnesota and has everythingso I can think of no better gift than to let her shop to her hearts content where she can get almost anything in the world
__label__Positive	Cute popup card
__label__Positive	Great product
__label__Positive	Easy to give the kidsthey all know how to use the system and can shop to their hearts content  I dont have to choose gifts they may not like and everybodys happym
__label__Positive	It was sent for a teenage rIt ticked all the boxes to give a youngster not only a gift voucher but a amusing one

__label__Positive	An easy present for an not so easy person to buy for
__label__Positive	These always are appreciated  and are a quick way of  someone
__label__Positive	Easy to use
__label__Positive	Simple and quick

__label__Positive	Show some love show some appreciation Everybody loves shoes
Instant delivery so if youre running late or just forgot to buy a gift for someone this is perfect
__label__Positive	Arrived on time and was perfect
__label__Positive	OK
__label__Positive	I get these for my kids teachers  I also got them as prizes for the games at my office holiday party  Good deal without a trip to the store
__label__Positive	Loved it
__label__Positive	When you are not in the same country or city is so convenient for a birthday present and hundreds of possibilities of different items
__label__Positive	He liked the neat tin and the card inside Perfect when you dont what to get someone
__label__Negative	The envelope was dirty and the bells on the ribbon were crushed I have to put the gift card in a new envelope to give as a gift i will not be using this packaging Very disappointed
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Loved it I bought several for gifts for my fellow amazon prime members The only thing that would make it better is if it had blue prime tape
__label__Positive	I would recommend this card to anyone who gets their hair done at any of the accepted locations its fast easy to use and really made easy to buy on Amazon
__label__Negative	Do not buy a Fandango Gift card  You think you are giving someone a gift of 25  No you arent  Your gift recipient can only use through Fandango not directly at the box office  Fandango will charge a convenience fee for every ticket purchased using the gift card  Your recipient will lose about 12 of your gift to convenience fees
__label__Positive	It is a very good way to send a gift from one country Switzerland to another USA without having extra costs my friend can now buy whatever she discovers searching amazoncom Good idea and excellent service
__label__Positive	The process was quick and easy especially for a last minute gift I had no ideas
this was possible until my daughter clued me in
__label__Positive	Lovely
__label__Positive	I loved that I only paid 50 for the GC but received an adorable Santa tin box and free shipping  Way to go Amazon
__label__Positive	great gift and the box for the card is pretty cool
__label__Positive	Card was lively fun and appreciated
__label__Positive	Adorable Amazon box for the gift card I purchased the birthday mailbox offered on Amazon and this fit right in Cute presentation
__label__Positive	Email delivery is dope
__label__Positive	Appreciated the attractive box to house the gift card as it had to be transported to California  easier not to lose and more secure than an envelope  Also liked the silver snowflake container  I did not receive a GUND bear like my daughter did who ordered about the same time  Both orders were for 15000  I am a Prime member
__label__Positive	Loved the gift card
__label__Positive	Best gift card I ever gave somebody 200 bucks Holy cow They bought so much stuff with this gift card
__label__Positive	Loved it  A great gift for those who have almost everything from Amazon
__label__Positive	nice and easy even if you forgot to buy a gift anyone can use the gift card and get it fast
__label__Negative	Disaster Never ever ever have I had such a difficult time getting and using a gift card Still have no GC number or pin Now a little boy has to wait until this is sorted out  Some Christmas present
__label__Positive	Great gift to give
__label__Positive	As described

__label__Positive	I surprised my two sisters with these gift cards The look on the faces was worth it
__label__Positive	Love the convenience of this gift card great gift an my sister received it so fast
__label__Neutral	The card was fine  The problem was the card was promised for delivery before Christmas but arrived on or about the 28th of December 2015  This was stress provoking
__label__Positive	I was very happy with this BirthdayGiftcard
__label__Positive	Pretty clever
__label__Positive	My friend loves Starbucks and I know that she will love this as her Hanukkah gift present
__label__Positive	Always a very popular choice

__label__Positive	This was a perfect gift
__label__Positive	bueno
__label__Positive	Bought as a gift They love it
__label__Positive	Gift card  the ultimate flexible gift

Dont know his exact preferences or what he may find so he can use the gift card
__label__Positive	The recipient loved it She could get all the things she registered for and didnt receive
After seeing her joy I knew that I had made the right choice
__label__Positive	You read the title So i instantly printed out the gift card and used it that night
__label__Positive	I was very happy with the Amazon Gift Card as it was a very straight forward and convenient way to send a gift  The person I purchased the card for was delighted and said they enjoyed  browsing and purchasing items on the Amazon site  I will definitely be purchasing cards again as gifts in the near future
__label__Positive	Easy quick  great way to use money when travelling
__label__Positive	As expected
__label__Positive	The availability to print the gift card rather than have to find a store to purchase it was a great benefit It does need the ability to set your own amount rather than having to choose one of theirs  I wanted 225 but that was not an option
__label__Positive	Great idea for a birthday gift They can pick from a wide range of products
__label__Positive	Always a great gift
__label__Positive	 
__label__Positive	My brother loved his Starbucks birthday gift cards
__label__Positive	I work for a company in Denver where I received an appreciation award  This award came with a dollar value that I turned in for Amazon gift cards  I used the gift cards to purchase several items from Amazon  This was a great experience for me
__label__Positive	Swipe it and go its a simple as it gets Nothing else really to be said
__label__Neutral	24 hours delay for buying a gift card online  unacceptable Ruined the surprise
__label__Neutral	Looking for 10000 but it was either 75 or 150 so you missed a 25 sale
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Taking out my crayons and coloringin the gift card which was to accompany our congratulations to a friend who just got her PhD  was a whole lot more fun than finding one that would just say congratulations  And resorting to the one talent weve retained since childhood  coloring within the lines  showed her that we too had SOMETHING special of ours to share with her

__label__Positive	I needed a 60 gift for my soninlaw for Christmas An Amazon gift card was the perfect gift He wasted no time in ordering some items from Amazon and the free shipping was a bonus The card arrived very quickly so my concerns about whether it would be here in time for Christmas were for nothing Thank you Amazon

__label__Positive	Very convenient and my friend was able to make her purchases online with it all the way from Germany where she her husband and their baby were stationed
__label__Negative	My gift card arrived with many scratches across the front and the cardboard it was attached to was bent  I cannot give this as a gift
__label__Positive	a box is a box
__label__Positive	This is the first time that Ive purchased a gift card on Amazon and it was emailed to him at the table while we were out for a birthday dinner  The look on his face was GREAT when his iphone rang and he opened the email with the gift card attached  My nephew now 30 is past the ribbons and bows of kids birthday presents and this way he can get what he wants when he wants  The fact that there was a little animated humor involved made it that more special  Good job

__label__Positive	gift no problem emailing
__label__Positive	Quick and easy to buy

__label__Neutral	I really wanted a card that could be used to purchase movies on Amazon for my granddaughters Kindle This was not useful for that She used it to buy some Amazon products so although she may have enjoyed using it for clothes that is not what we really wanted it for
__label__Positive	Perfect 11 savings
__label__Positive	I like purchasing Amazon gift cards because it is so convient to use when buying books All you have do is click to buy and its done

__label__Negative	Have tried clicking the link opening in new tab Will try to send it to a gmail and see if it will open
__label__Positive	Made for a perfect Christmas gift It was great to hear throughout the year family and friends tell me what they eventually used it to buy
__label__Positive	Its absolutely amazing I bought this gift card for a 25 value and when it arrived it had 25 credit value on it Can you believe it Nice to see a product that works these days And yes I a being sarcastic Do we really need to rate a gift card
__label__Positive	Love the cases
__label__Positive	As described
__label__Positive	Easy to use
__label__Positive	Just got the Thank You saying she will put the card to good use  She is going back to Germany for the next few months so this worked out good to give her something she might be able to use from over there
__label__Positive	It was a great and easy gift
__label__Positive	Bought for my husband along with his electronic reader  He was happy to choose books to load
__label__Positive	He very much enjoyed it
__label__Positive	shipped the very next day for a last minute birthday party and the cupcake tins were really cute

__label__Positive	I purchased this for my brother for his main birthday gift because I knew he had a few things on amazon he wanted I was browsing gift card holders but most did not stand out until I stumbled upon this one and KNEW I had to order it My brother loved the packaging for it and even posted it up on social media for everyone to see This is ridiculously cute and unique as a gift card holderplus who doesnt love amazon I can guarantee youll find at least one thing you want off of the website haha The gift card holder is well made sturdy and really resembles a miniature cardboard box There is great attention to detail on the tape of the box and its magnetized too I thought it was so cute I was going to order one for myself just to display This is one of those things where you say SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY P I would give this item 100 stars if possible
__label__Positive	Very good comments
__label__Positive	incredible selection to choose from loved that any dollar amount was able to be on the card just a wonderful gift

__label__Positive	Been sending Amazon gift cards as presents for years Tip If a recipient responds with a dufus question like How do I use thisdont send one to them anymore They dont deserve it Amazon gift cards are the truly perfect gift besides the gift of yourself Done and done

__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	This was for my granddaughter and she was happy
__label__Positive	Worked out great  Mom and Dad had their register on Amazon So what better than a Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Amazon printable gift cards are the perfect solution when you need a last minute gift If you are looking for something for a hostess or that hard to shop for family member this is perfect They can get exactly what they want and all you have to do is print it off for them at home or send them an email containing their gift
This particular purchase was a Christmas gift for someone that travels a lot and uses audio books to pass the time They were extremely appreciative and I would definitely considering giving them an Amazon gift card in the future

__label__Positive	What can I say  You always get your moneys worth
__label__Positive	Gift card holder was made of paper I thought it would be plastic or metal Other than that it makes a great gift for my brotherinlaw for Christmas Would buy again

After reading the reviews I was little concerned about the qualify of the box Some said they got a damaged box But mine is in perfect condition and I found none of the recent reviews have this qualify issue I will definitely choose this gift next time
__label__Positive	Cool little tin  with gift card
__label__Positive	Gift cards are huge success for everyone It is easy to do especially at the last minute The recipient loves getting something they can use at Amazon
__label__Positive	Its pretty much what I expected Its tin material container with a standard sized gift card It was a present for my mom and she appreciated it I like how it can potentially be reused for containers for small things like batteries or earphones The tin wasnt without flaws like scratches and dents but honestly they were barely visible for me Looking at other peoples reviews and pictures though I think its hit or miss I guess I got lucky
__label__Positive	Amazon eCards are always the best way to go I even sent this one to the wrong email address all it took was one phone call when I realized my mistake and all was well again Thank you Amazon 3 generations of my family love you AND look forward to any occasion to send each other more eCards
__label__Positive	I sent this to one of my grandchildren and they were able to purcahse exactly what they wanted  that works for me
__label__Positive	This was a gift The recipient an avid user of Amazoncom  raved about how cute the box was She was happy so I am happy  
__label__Positive	Too easy  Everyone got what they wanted  HOHOHO
__label__Positive	This product is quite excellent It was delivered ahead of time and arrived in good condition So far its a big help in my apartment organizing effort prior to a major move I plan to use the shreds for packing material
__label__Neutral	I would have loved for my name to appear on card somewhere She didnt even know it was from my husband and me I also received a 40 dollar gift card and my husband also 40 dollar I had no idea my daughter had sent us gift cards for Christmas She also is complaining about this

__label__Negative	This is a fun way to overpay for shipping You can save a dollar on your gift card you pay 499 to have the envelope shipped to you I dont understand the world any longer
__label__Positive	what a teenager needed
__label__Positive	Perfect for a women that has everything
__label__Positive	Nice tin

__label__Positive	so great to be able to give something knowing that the receiver is able to urchase something they really want
__label__Positive	liked it a lot
__label__Positive	Easy to use and delivered in seconds
__label__Positive	Something you can get last minute that doesnt look last minute So easy to do and so cute Plus who doesnt want an amazon gift card
__label__Positive	with an amazon gift card endless possibilities for the receiver great gift to give those impossibletobuyfor people  I was late mailing birthday card with one click the emailed gift card arrived on time
__label__Positive	Got this for my niece and she loves it
__label__Positive	Made my son happy since he spends most of his life in Starbucks
__label__Positive	Aaaaaaaaaaah who doesnt love Starbucks  Of course this was great  Love it
__label__Positive	This is a great way to get a gift across the states last minute Or maybe a birthday you forgot You save them time and money and even a little gas with this you could shop Anazon anywhere on your phone Very cool
__label__Negative	Not refundable if it isnt accepted by recipient Disappointing since its obvious code wasnt used and code could easily be cancelled  Wont buy again Several recipients couldnt figure out how to use it and i was left unable to get a refund even after contacting customer service
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Negative	Deserves 0 stars  Fandango is simply a service which most dont realize  The gift card can only be used to purchase movie tickets online not at the theater  You must pay a FEE of 135 for each ticket purchased so technically with the cost of a 1125 movie ticket and 135 fee I can only afford to buy 1ticket with this 25 gift card  Such absolute BS  I am furious that there are no regulations on gift cards  ZERO buyers would spend money on this card if they understood the termswhich is only know AFTER its purchased
__label__Positive	What is there not to love about these adorable characters  Been sending and purchasing these cards for my nieces for years
__label__Positive	I love these boxes Made a special gift out of a normal gift card and I received it quickly for Christmas 2013 I will be purchasing this or similar items from Amazon for Christmas 2014
__label__Positive	Recipient very happy
__label__Positive	Great Easy product to use and doesnt require any unnecessary steps I will definitely buy this product again soon sometime
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift Cards are excellent gift for birthdays and any occasion will continue to buy whenever I need a present for anyone
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for kids away at college
__label__Neutral	Not sure the parents were able to use it Sort of wish wed gone another direction
__label__Positive	This was a very good gift and I will use this gift idea again The gift was sent to a relative in another state I was a little concerned about the security of the gift card I was not completely confident that the card could end up being stolen and used by someone other than the person I gifted however all went well and the card was received by the gifted person  Advice on how to insure that the card will not fall into the wrong hands would be comforting
__label__Positive	SO fast and reliable
__label__Positive	Love Taco Bell
__label__Positive	I just love being able to attach a picture on a gift card  What a novel idea  I know it was received by the recipient because they confirmed it
__label__Positive	Never used Amazon before so this gift card was a good start  My married children shop on Amazon alot  The gift card was for my daughters birthday and she loved it especially knowing that I dont shop on line  I guess Ill do more now as another birthday is coming  in our family  I found your website easy to use  Thanks 
__label__Positive	The order process is easy to work with notification to recipient is prompt and everyone loves an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	As described
__label__Positive	Awesome Quick Easy gift to send to a loved one 12 days a greeting card a special message and a gift card all for ten bucks EVEN no tax no shipping no charge for the greeting card or the special message which makes it even better defintley worth the money
__label__Positive	Although extensive choice of cards felt there was limited choice for a lads 21st birthday However it was OK and printed out allright Dont know if he has successfully used it yet
__label__Positive	My family shops on Amazon  They have Kindles and iPads and love reading downloaded books  So easy to buy an Amazon gift card for them
__label__Positive	Great way to send a gift to someone who is difficult to shop for  It was delivered immediately and my son was very thankful for the gift
__label__Positive	My Grandson loved his Gift Card with the adorable kitten  He is a Cat Lover so it was Very Special to him  Thank you for such wonderful Gift Card choices
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Immediate receipt great product
__label__Positive	This animated card was funny to watch and listen to
__label__Positive	Easy gift I know hell use
__label__Positive	great easy gift
__label__Negative	I bought this gift card as a lightning deal from Amazon and it doesnt work I waited for a sale at Motherhood filled my basket entered the gift card number and NOTHING I called and Amazon says everything looks good on their end so are not willing to rectify the situation Hoping Im not out 50
__label__Positive	its a gift card whats to review
__label__Positive	I received this card unexpected gist card I have been having fun shopping in Amazon Have you seen all of the things you can buy There is a Candy store for person who like shop  A Wilson
__label__Positive	All good No problems
__label__Neutral	The gift cards are fine but I needed to purchase 4 boxes and were not told until much later that it was not possible to order more than 2 boxes with each order  This delayed my purchase   I wasnt told until a full day after the order was successfully submitted that it was not possible to process the order  It should be stated in the details before an order is placed rather than finding out later  It would have also been nice if we as a business could have personalized the cards with our logo as these were gifts to customers
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	What can you say about a gift card  It arrived on time and worked as expected will order again
__label__Positive	The whole process took 2 minutes on my cell It was very convenient The recipient didnt have any issues using it
__label__Positive	quick  easy to order use
__label__Negative	Youd think that theyd provide a way to write who is sending the gift card if they are in the gift card business  Note  This is not a rating on the bear which I havent seen
__label__Negative	Zero balance
__label__Positive	Big Hit
__label__Positive	This is an awesome idea I purchased this Gift Card online and within 15 minutes I had a printed copy in my hand Now it feels much more personal that he will have a gift to open on Christmas instead of just checking his email
__label__Positive	Love the convenience of these gift cards
__label__Positive	Short of time and short on ideas  I remembered my son in law was reading more and more on the iPad Kindle  App and logged on to Amazon for ideas
He was delighted when he opened his birthday card and found the gift card mind you he was also wondering why I was not holding a gift bag and said he had a long list of  books he wanted to buy
The whole process was so easy and the for the next gift card I will make sure Ihave a better quality paper to match the great color and designs of the cards though perhaps a few more younger  funny ones would be welcome
__label__Positive	This was super handymade shopping easy
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Good gift for a friend I assume they liked it
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Neutral	The only problem I had with this was it did not arrive until a week later
__label__Positive	So much more convenient than going to the store
__label__Negative	I reviewed this product a week or so ago and the author contacted me Thats a first and asked that I remove the review since he felt it would dissuade others from benefitting from his unique wisdom Upon reflection I may have been a bit harsh so I will try to give as objective review as I can

First this is not a video It is a PowerPoint presentation and the author reads every word on every page slowlyveryveryslowly So slowly that I had to check during the lulls to see that the presentation was in fact advancing

This is not the Ultimate anything If you have a camera with buttons or dials you already have an inkling of what ISO aperture and shutter speed are If you know these things and are looking for help composing pictures well youre pretty much out of luck there

Heres a synopsis of the modules

Module 1 Know your camera If youre going to be fiddling with settings you need to know how to fiddle Good advice

Module 2 ISO ISO is the sensitivity of the sensor in your digital camera The higher the number the more sensitive But the higher the number the noisier blurrier the image may be

Module 3 Aperture The aperture measures how wide open the lens is The wider it is the more light gets in But as with ISO less will leave your pictures too dark and more may not always be better

Module 3 Shutter Speed Again it controls how much light strikes the sensor by how fast it opens and closes

Module 4 Putting it all together A proper exposure is achieved by the proper combination of ISO Aperture and Shutter Speed If you change one you must change another For instance If you open the aperture you must either lower the ISO or raise the shutter speed to get the correct exposure Opening the aperture will let in more light so you must make your sensor less sensitive via ISO or allow less light via a faster shutter speed

Module 5 Metering This is all about seeing light If your subject is backlit for instance they will appear as a silhouette unless you meter on their face This module is all about how and where to fix your attention where to meter the light and is pretty good actually

Module 6 Light and Composition There are things that make a good photo good Rules that seem hardwired into the human psyche The author mentions them briefly Things like the rule of 3rds texturing patterns and whatnot Problem is he doesnt explain why these things work much less provide examples to demonstrate how they work

Module 7 Completion Here the author summarizes what is in my opinion just a summary hardly an Ultimate course and emboldens the reader to go out and achieve greatness

Not all that negative hey So why 2 stars First as I said it is not Ultimate by any stretch of the imagination More than half the book is dedicated to things you already know And the area you really need help well he glosses over it leaving more questions than answers

And second it not a video If you bought the authors book you have the script Yes he reads everything on every screen

Third he says the course is worth 250 then offers a special deep discount I think thats lesson 1 in the expletive deleted marketing manual Honestly this would have made a good 250 Kindle ebook

Lastly the hype bugs me The author states over and over how awesome your photographs will be if you just follow his rules As if understanding a few fundamentals of photography will make you the next Bresson

2 stars and thats as honest as it gets
__label__Positive	Easy as pie  The recipient was happy with it also  Will definitely do this again  the gidt was appreciated and easy to use

__label__Positive	BIEN
__label__Positive	Great product
__label__Positive	At the last minute I decided Id like to give my daughterinlaw a Mothers Day gift but it seemed too late  Knowing shes an Amazon fan I thought Id check to see if I could somehow send a gift card electronically  She was thanking me within minutes  Im a computer dummy so was afraid I couldnt figure out how to make it work but it was easy
__label__Positive	The AMC website was having a problem so I was directed to purchase from Amazon Worked way easier Will probably always buy my AMC gift cards on Amazon from now on
__label__Positive	It is a gift card

__label__Positive	After foolishly sending cash in the mail inside a birthday card and having it stolen I switched to sending these Amazon gift cards via Facebook  The recipients have been delighted  Its easy and immediate  The way to go
__label__Positive	The picture I used for the front of the card came out really clear I liked the ease of just printing the card with the gift info right on it its great for last minutes gifts too because its emailed to you rather than mailed

__label__Positive	I needed a last minute gift and this was the perfect choice I simply entered the amount the name of the recipient paid for it and then printed a nice little card with the design I chose What more can I say a great idea for procrastinators like me  
__label__Negative	I purchased about 270 in Airbnb gift cards on Amazon When I tried to apply them to my account they wouldnt work I contacted Airbnb and they told me the cards have 0 on them After asking to speak to a supervisor they agreed to give me 140 SO I lost 130 Amazon told me theres nothing they could do about it

__label__Positive	Love the convenience and LOVE that my busier friends can choose their treat at their convenienceno extra steps to or from all their other tasks
__label__Negative	The above item was requested for immediate delivery on 52414  I was notified that it had been sent but never informed it was delivered  I had to go through customer service to have it delivered

Also on 51114  I ordered another gift card to be delivered to a different recipient which was marked as sent but never as  delivered  After contacting customer service I was informed that it was undeliverable and the charge was credited to my credit card

The problem is I was never contacted about these problems  Up until now I thought Amazon Gift  Cards was a great idea  However I NO LONGER HAVE ANY FAITH THAT I CAN ORDER A GIFT CARD AND BELIEVE IT WILL BE DELIVERED  Especially since I am never notified that there is a problem with the delivery the most important part  I am extremely disappointed

From my last two experiences it is apparent that Amazon has a problem with deliveries andor notifying the customer when it occurs and trying to work the problem out
__label__Positive	loved the card
__label__Positive	As usual my gift cards arrived to their destination on time  I havent heard how this last visit was as of yet but my brother usually loves this restaurant  Thank you for offering this  Best way to give something to someone who has everything they need

__label__Positive	This is a well designed tray  The Santa belt says Merry Christmas now spend me
__label__Negative	The card had been redeemed before I got it
__label__Positive	The only down side was that the person receiving the gift had no idea who it was from  I would have thought that you would say who it was from
__label__Positive	Cute and soft
__label__Positive	My mother inlaw loves her shoes
__label__Positive	Just what I wanted lovely 
__label__Positive	convenient Reasonable Something for everyone  Better than average for this type of food Best of all they serve breakfast anytime
__label__Positive	Kind of hard to rate a gift card but here is goes great gift card  25 is a good amount  Enough to make someone else happy but not too much as too break the bank  5 stars
__label__Positive	Easy gift giving
__label__Positive	I buy this for myself just as you would in order to have prepaid cash for your Kindle Its the ideal way to avoid tons of entries in you bank account statement and to control your budget ie 100 every three months

__label__Positive	Perfect gift
__label__Positive	Quick delivery Worked great

__label__Positive	Whats not to love with a gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Was a bit overwhelmed with trying to decide on a baby gift  Got the gift cards
__label__Positive	i love you
__label__Positive	It semed a little confusing as to what your really needed when you use it so I printed up all the pages and gave to couple as a gift  Otherwise it was okay
__label__Positive	Gift card for Amazon Seriously what can You not like about this   Not a single thing 
__label__Positive	This was a great gift

__label__Positive	It was quick and easy to upload a picture to personalize the gift card I liked that you were able to add a message too I was going to buy from a big box retailer but wouldnt let me add a message or anything Thats why I went with Amazon I got to add a picture if I wanted too and a message

__label__Positive	And my dad loved the gift It was quick and easy to put together I would recommend this to anyone who needed a quick gift

__label__Positive	Great Item
__label__Positive	It was easy to send electronically and less likely to get lost Plus Amazon has been a very secure and dependable for for me to order and the receiptant can find what they want or need
__label__Positive	We have a teenage granddaughter  never know what she wants from minute to minute  This works great because there are so many products available and having a gift card is a little like browsing the old Sears Roebuck or Montgomery Ward Christmas catalog
__label__Positive	Perfect Gift
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	A real hit
__label__Negative	Could not use more than one gift card on the website
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Neutral	I thought an Amazon kindle gift card would be a great gift for my parents who are avid readers I was VERY disappointed to find that it was automatically purchased in US dollars and that this was not clear on the website Given the exchange rate to AUS dollars this made the gift more expensive than I had expected I wont be buying another one
__label__Positive	Its a gift card Not much to review here
__label__Positive	A

__label__Positive	I would love to review all of my recent purchases as I have been very happy  for 2 reasons I have decided not to review my recent purchases 1 I ordered beads for my bracelet and necklace pendant prior to Christmas  I received the pendant with a note stating the beads would be mailed within 7 days  I have Emailed the company AZ Store 643 South Olive Street 900 Los Angeles CA 90014 3 times however have not received any response the beads or my mailing refund to date  2 I did previously review an item that I purchased and really liked 5 stars however received a very insulting response from Amazon giving numerous reasons why they could not use my review  For the above reasons I think it best I do not review however I still order from Amazon give gift cards love my Kindle and will continue shopping with you  Thank you Deborah

Winwin
__label__Positive	As advertised
__label__Positive	Emailed quickly Everything as expected Very convenient
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with a gift card When you have no idea what to get someone for their baby shower go with a gift card They can choose whatever they wantneed When the baby registry is filled with items priced outside your budget the gift card is a great option
__label__Positive	This is ideal if youre fine with printing it and stuffing it in an envelope yourself  I prefer plastic cards but it served its purpose
__label__Positive	An Amazon gift card via email was easy to use and the perfect gift for an out of town relative
__label__Negative	you guys should go in together and get a lawyer or call the news there are many claims here saying they were ripped off the news and the bbb should be contacted
__label__Positive	Love being able to personalize the card  Made it special for my sister  Well on the second try  Didnt quite follow ALL the instructions to the end to complete the purchase but we worked it out only a few days late  Totally operator error
__label__Positive	Very cool packaging
__label__Positive	Easy and fast
__label__Positive	Great 
__label__Positive	Great stocking stuffer My kids loved it more than their gifts lol  Like parents know

__label__Positive	I got this gift card as a birthday gift for my sister in law My niece loved it just as much Better than picking up what I believe she would like was to give her the opportunity to choose from the convenience of her home
__label__Positive	Great for my teen grandson who I didnt know what he wanted  He really liked it because he got to choose
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly
__label__Positive	they didnt know who it came from It was a gift sent in a gift box it should have included a name from the one who sent
__label__Positive	It got to my Valentine and she enjoyed it So Im happy You cant go wrong with it never any major issues getting it to her
__label__Positive	So simple to send gift
__label__Positive	I love being able to print gift cards right away much easier than going to the store especially if it was at the last minute
__label__Positive	perfect
__label__Positive	You can buy anything you ever possibly would need from Amazon even TV shows and movies Anyone of all ages can use this super convenient gift
__label__Positive	EXCELLENT
__label__Positive	very easy to order for my daddys 85th bd he uses amazon online to order  any time  anything  for his bd easy to track it to check it amazon online will order again in the future
__label__Positive	EXCELENT
__label__Positive	Good Got to my nephew just in time for Christmas

__label__Positive	good deal gift for an adult
__label__Positive	worked good
__label__Positive	perfect gift
__label__Positive	It was easy to use I just showed them on my phone and it went by quickly
__label__Positive	Just arrived  Bought a 25 and a 50 and immediately went online to check balances  The Bubba Gump website did not work for the number of digits on this card which scared me at first  I went to the Landrys site after and there I could input all digits and get an accurate balance  Both cards are preloaded with the denominations specified  Perfect for my upcoming vacation with family that wont otherwise let me pay for dinner well if I dont pay then these giftcards are totally wasted
__label__Positive	Wonderful way to pick up Fathers Day gift for 1 man in my life  Couldnt get out to shop this year so the gift card was perfect choice for him  It was a complete surprise and he was very happy  May well consider this option again soon
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Gift cards always are good for Amazon as giftsself

__label__Negative	This was a terrble disappointment Amazon just sent the gift card together with 2 other gift cards in a box with no message to the recipients This was a gift to my son and his wife together with two cards fom Starbucks for each grand daughter When I purchased these I wrote a lovely note to each recipient with my wishes for the occasion Instead a box was delivered with a commercial name on the box totally unrelated to inside items  and they had NO IDEA that the three gift cards inside were from me their mother and grandmother  I would have been better off doing the mailing by myself and will not participate in this type of gift giving from Amazon again
__label__Negative	this was the worst thing i have ever done the card i sent to my friend was redeemed however his items were not recieved the customer serivce for amazon is the worst i have ever seen i would never recommend using them again  i lost my 100 dollars and my friend never got his stuff

__label__Positive	It was just what I was looking for  A real personal touch to a gift card I plan to use this idea for holidays as well
__label__Positive	gift was well recieved
__label__Positive	We were able to use the gift card to purchase tickets  What they dont tell you is that they only accept one gift card per order online  So if you purchase two cards thinking it will cover the entire ticket purchase it wont  The balance will be charged to a credit card that you must provide at the time of purchase  As long as you know that and they should have indicated that on their website definitely a good gift idea  Can also be used at the theater
__label__Negative	The ECA is a scam organization that has been taking peoples money for 3 years and has absolutely nothing to show for it besides mediocre retailer discounts It all came to a head when they showed their true colors and how much they really care about the gamers they claim to represent by going out of their way to make it difficult for members to cancel their membership in order to make more money via their forced autorenewal system which automatically bills you

When members complained the organization turned on its own members and shut down the forums in order to stop people from complaining and exposing their shady tactics and policies The head of the ECA Hal Halpin even went out of his way to threaten those who complained by saying that reporting the ECA to the BBB or your bank would result in you being investigated for fraud

Do not sign up for the ECA and never ever give them your money or credit card information

__label__Negative	I spend 1K on these for my office Christmas party  I got a lot of them ranging from 50 to 100  I gave them to people I work with  So far 4 of them have been blank  0 on them  This is embarrassing for me and the people I gave them too originally were not going to tell me  They thought I just gave them a blank card  Amazon has been helpful but I have had to spend 2 hours on the phone to get this straightened out  Amazon has had a hard time finding the gift card even though I have the order and the numbers for each card  So do yourself a favor save time and save yourself embarrassment  give cash instead

__label__Negative	I received two Zaxbys gift cards and both had no balance on them I only found this out after I went to Zaxbys and held up the line trying to find out what was going on Zaxbys told me they have nothing to do with the gift cards and that I had to contact amazon I paid for my order with cash which upset me since I had two empty gift cards that I paid for When I got home I talked to Amazon who acted like I was crazy After about 20 mins of talking with them they finally said they would investigate but they never got back to me The following day I got an email saying the order shipped from amazon with no mention of my problem even though I had received it the day before and already tried to use at Zaxbys which was very strange I decided to go to the Zaxbys website and see if the money was added to my empty card and it was Very annoying Lesson learned Check gift card balance before you try to use it might be empty
__label__Positive	When you have a son who is not sure what he wants an Amazon gift card has it all  In fact his orginial thought for its use changed as he perused all the options
__label__Positive	ok
__label__Positive	Nice unspectacular restaurant
__label__Negative	Was only delivered to part of my list All other emails have gone through and spam folders are empty so not sure what happened
__label__Positive	Had a lot of fun using this feature  Bought it for a friend to buy a backpack for her daughter to go back to school  I got to add a funny picture of my own and a funny caption to go with it  It was nice to not have to conform to the preset standards that many places including printed cards want to hand you for these situations  This girl needs some fun with her gift selection and this product offered just that
__label__Positive	This product was as described and will be very much appreciated on Christmas If you have a Starrbucks lover in your family this will be a great hit

__label__Positive	Quick 23 minutes Had no issues redeeming code 13 Ordered Pizza
__label__Negative	The tin isnt worth a darn Big rectangular hole in the back When people choose the tin instead of the greeting card or just an envelope its because they plan to keep the tin and use it These are absolutely worthless Not even worth the cost of free
__label__Positive	Works and no problems
__label__Positive	so cute
__label__Positive	The snowflake tin is very pretty and a nice way to present the gift card
__label__Positive	great  thanks
__label__Positive	Awesome
__label__Positive	Gave the gift to my sister and I am sure she used it quickly I assume it worked out for her
__label__Positive	This card came with a Kindle Fire which I am addicted to  The card was easy to use and I plan on ordering more
__label__Positive	Not sure what to say This gift card had the correct amount on it
__label__Positive	My granddaughter loved it
__label__Positive	The gift card was just what she wanted Loved it Would buy one again now I need one  Love it
__label__Positive	I was very happy with how this product works An Amazon gift card is a good gift to give as it allows the recipient to choose just the right present Being able to send it via Facebook was so convenient for me as I was laid up with a foot injury and couldnt get out to shop or delivery gifts to friends and family The process worked smoothly and everyone received their cards and redeemed their cards with no problems Excellent

__label__Positive	Very cute My friend loved the heartfelt but funny message
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly for my purchase Bought it on Prime Day for 5 off so I saved a little money too No fuss no muss though I think it was overkill to send this tiny card all by itself I do wish Amazon would combine as much as possible and yes I check that box
__label__Positive	Amazon gift card is always the perfect gift
__label__Positive	Excellent service and the food was the best
__label__Positive	It was a nice card I gave it to my soninlaw  for his birthday  Hes saving up money on Amazon to buy a camera hes wanted to purchase

__label__Positive	Always tasty  Using to treat my grandchildren when they visit
__label__Positive	CArd has no money on it
__label__Positive	I got this for my mom for Christmas and it was a great gift for her the only thing I didnt like was the bottom of the box it comes in has a clear strip that shows the back of the card so if she had picked it up before Christmas she would have known it was a gift card
__label__Positive	Loved this gift  so fun to hang on the tree for the recipient to locate I also received 1 day free shipping which was so great right before Christmas
__label__Negative	The gift card works just fine but when you buy a gift card most times you want a certain lookstyle The gift card is nothing like the picture Its an ugly brown stuck to an ugly dingy yellow card If I didnt know better I would think its from the 70s I wouldnt buy again just because I want the gift card to be eye catching to the gift receiver Ill just go to Kroger next time to purchase a gift card
__label__Positive	great food
__label__Positive	Lots to chose from Quick shipping Fun to send
__label__Positive	This was a great gift for a friend and it was greatly appreciated

__label__Positive	This was a great idea for a gift card for those who celebrate Christmas or the Holidays
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are perfect for times you cant think of what to buy for someone or just dont have the time to shop They come in a multitude of designs that will fit the occasion
__label__Positive	Got this for my daughter for Christmas  She loves Qdoba and loved getting this card  I would highly recommend getting this card
__label__Positive	The Best Gift for anyone
__label__Positive	Lovely
__label__Positive	Our son was very happy with this gift
__label__Negative	Daughter received card for Christmas present  Theater would not except it  What
a rip off  Fandango is a joke What a waste of 25 00  Gift of cash a better idea You dont deserve a single star FANDANGO 
__label__Positive	Got exactly what I paid for Fast delivery too
__label__Positive	My gift card came fast in a really nice boxenvelope with no extra charge I didnt even have to wrap it which also saved me

__label__Positive	Excellent Product for a gift
__label__Neutral	k

__label__Positive	Fake cash is always a good gift Rinse Repeat Fake cash is always a good gift Gift cards are always welcome
__label__Positive	It was impressive how quickly the gift card was delivered  It was exactly what I wanted Start to finish this was a great experience

__label__Positive	Worked fine
__label__Positive	Great purchase
__label__Positive	I ordered 2 of these but as far as I know only one went thru I feel this is a great Idea that Amazon has
__label__Positive	Gift for adult grandsons
__label__Negative	I tried for hours total over three days to use the email gift card and finally gave up  Wonfer if they care  Worked just fine earlier this year for a birthday  Oh well Ill belatedly use someone else
__label__Positive	Love having this option to reach friends quickly while giving them so many options for them to consider
__label__Positive	What a great stocking stuffer for multiple people Everyone loved it as a gift I will likely buy restaurant gift cards this way again
If you just need a little extra for a gift or have many people you need to buy for this is a great idea I could see this being a good idea for coworkers as well for a secret Santa Christmas gift Really the possibilities are endless you can really gift them to anyone you can think of
__label__Negative	Twice I ordered for a gift and it didnt go through to the person
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	perfect when you dont know what the kids want
__label__Positive	It was so easy to upload the photo and then print the card  It looked like it took me a lot of time and effort to create when in fact it only took about 2 minutes  Love the convenience and the fact that I could print it right away since I waited until the last minute to do it
__label__Positive	its a gift card how can you go wrong
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Handy way for a birthday present I use it every year so people get buy whatever they want with it
__label__Positive	They loved the ability to go online and buy what they wanted  Best birthday present per the recipient  Thank you
__label__Negative	I tried uploading 3 times and it never worked I build websites and apps for a living so it shouldnt be a user issue
__label__Negative	It takes 24 hours for the gift card to process Dont buy then go to the restaurant You will have to pay out of pocket if you do
__label__Positive	Gift that was appreciated
__label__Positive	Great idea my family were very happy 
__label__Positive	Arrive as promised Thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	Quick and easy and the recipient loved it I will definitely buy more in the future Its hard to beat Amazons prices on many things especially with no sales tax
__label__Positive	It came as expected and gift receiptient love it and love the gift box that was amazing truly an awesome gift for someone or your self
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like an Amazon gift card  Perfect gift delivered to my door
__label__Positive	I have a Windows phone so buying stuff on the store this comes in handy if you dont want to use your credit card
__label__Positive	I found it a bit odd to be asked by Amazon if this product met my expectations and to write a review on it First of all it is a gift card which I certainly expect should work as a gift card is supposed to work Otherwise I would certainly have complained already Secondly it is a gift so it is my nieces expectations that are more important than mine She was happy to receive it and Im glad it was so easy to purchase this gift card for her online so I do believe that everyones expectations were indeed met
__label__Positive	Its an adorable free bear What could be bad about that
__label__Positive	Great for our granddaughter
__label__Positive	I do love the new collections of animated greeting cards Amazon is providing  Everybody in our family receives Amazon Gift Certificates from us for birthdays etc  This pretty pink kitty sings so well

__label__Positive	They are always happy to get a gift card for Starbucks
__label__Negative	Payment appeared as redeemed when the receiver did not get any items did not get a refund on it either
__label__Positive	Always buy AMAZON gift cards from Amazon
__label__Neutral	well i mean its a gift card in a box ok expectations are met without difficulty the box is fine etc however i did pay for the giftwrapping at 3 bucks and change each for these and another gift take it from me skip that expense really the wrap is completely unsatisfactory unremarkable and even though all this stuff arrived in the standard cover boxes like most amazon stuff arrives in all the gift wrappings had creases and dimples and scuffs i was disappointed and then some and i am seldom anything less than thrilled with amazon items
__label__Positive	I bought the gift card for my niece as a present to get her some money to buy books that she might like  She loved the present  Thanks

__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and once I figured out how to apply it in my app it was ready to go

__label__Positive	I am glad that Christmas is still Christmas and not just any old Holiday  And the birth of Jesus Christ is truly the reason for the season  Too many people try to make religious holidays just another day  As far as I am aware Christmas has been a holy day for centuries  Not too many people are going to like what I have just written

__label__Positive	There were many nice selections to choose from but I like this picture  Besides this is soooo much easier than having to shop for a gift from a list  I was able to buy in less than five minutes
__label__Positive	A
__label__Neutral	If Amazon is going to go through the trouble of creating a card box perhaps they should ship it in a way that does not get crushed like a tin can by the postal service A gift card is a gift card but my husband had to struggle to open his fathers day gift because the card box was crushed Disappointed
__label__Positive	Was perfect for what I needed
__label__Positive	we love whole foods and whole foods GC is the one of the best GC for our everyday life

__label__Positive	I received a great Christmas gift for my brotherinlaw He loves to shop on Amazon I know hell love it
__label__Positive	She loves Justice Stores therefore I purchased this gift card as a special treat for her  Personally I think Justice Stores products are a little overpriced
__label__Positive	Very nice packaging for a gift card  Makes a handsome appearance
__label__Positive	I got this as a birthday gift for my sister  She is hardly seen without a book or her kindle and she was absolutely thrilled with this gift  What better gift to give someone than the gift of choice  50 with amazon prime or a kindle goes a long way  Now I wish I had got a 100 gift card after hearing her excitement
__label__Positive	For far away kids this is a great way to send birthday greetings
__label__Positive	They are great when you dont want to use your credit card and are great gifts to give in a pinch
__label__Positive	This came really fast just as it states It wasnt hard to activate it into amazon gift card money either I would recommend this to other people if they know people who use amazon a lot because its a pretty neat gift 
__label__Positive	What a GREAT idea Now I always have gift cards at hand  whenever I need them without the fear of Oh what did I do with the Gift card that I bought yesterday
__label__Positive	I see there a lot of bad reviews on here so I am not going to give it a five star because Im sure there is some validity to them I agree that there is a convenience fee that makes the card seem silly but there is a movie theater in my area that is recliners and you can reserve your seat ahead of time on some sort of ticket app Being as it may you have to reserve your seat to get a good seat or even a seat at all In my circumstances I use Fandango no matter if I have a gift card or not I purchased the gift card when it was on a lightning deal and saved 5 so it was very much worth it To the topic that reviewer stated the gift card was not valid I did not come across this issue
__label__Positive	Geat Christmas gift
__label__Positive	convenient
__label__Positive	Chic and feminine
__label__Positive	My friend loved it
__label__Positive	I was delighted to receive a gift card for Amazon  I order books and other products from Amazon frequently so this was a special treat  I can usually find whatever I am looking for at Amazon and I found two great quilting books and a Greek textbook for a Christmas gift from my son  I am a very eclectic reader and order a variety of writings from Amazon

__label__Positive	Doesnt last very long Must be replaced often
__label__Negative	Please do not post to face book due to privacy settings
__label__Positive	Fabulous deal My daughter loves her bear
__label__Positive	Ok
__label__Positive	I dont trust buying gift cards from local stores have heard too many stories about someone other than the purchaser using gift cards once the store activate the cards Thats why I buy from Amazon The box is pretty and I appreciate that it is actually a gift box and not stamped AMAZON across it
__label__Positive	Super easy to order and delivery was less than 10 minutes  Id for sure use this way to order gift cards in the future
__label__Neutral	There was no place to write who it was from The person that received it mentioned it to her mother and decided it was from me She looked the certificate very carefully and  no where was my name

__label__Positive	great gift to give
__label__Neutral	Easy to buy and personalize

Recipient may simply have been rude by not acknowledging my gift or there may have been a processing error To my knowledge amazon doesnt provide receipt confirmation on these gift cards Very awkward 50 spent but no notice of receipt

__label__Positive	It came quick My brother is hanging on to it for Christmas for my niece We havent seen it yet
__label__Positive	An Amazon Gift Card is always a welcome gift
__label__Positive	I love Boston Market so when I saw the 50 card on sale for 40 I bought it
__label__Positive	The card was the right choice for the gift I was giving
__label__Positive	very goodi like it
__label__Positive	Easy access to purchase
__label__Positive	good looking easy to purchase last minute yet still personalized i printed mine on photo paper and it looked slick
__label__Positive	Yep its a gift card
__label__Positive	Very cute Exactly as pictured
__label__Positive	Great Price
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	Very good
__label__Positive	I love I Drunk now sorry
__label__Positive	Gift for a teacher The little movie is so funny
__label__Positive	The card was for a grandchild for Christmas and I wondered if it would make it for the holiday  It made it with time to spare and has been used to make a loving toy  It worked out very well
__label__Positive	Its a gift card Delivered promptly with the proper amount
__label__Positive	I gave 5 of these gift cards to young family members last year too The kids couldnt have been happier They enjoyed the value and also enjoyed the ordering itself
__label__Positive	Quick gift idea
__label__Positive	I purchased a birthday card with the Christmas card and both cards were delivered within two days and both cards were fabulous and unbelievable value for money now that I do not have a car shopping online has become a must and when I can get items like this it makes life very easy
__label__Positive	always a great gift
__label__Neutral	This is an excellent product

The service was very responsible The product came to me in time

I only regret that I have not gotten the product price as published in the ad as amazonom charged me an additional percentage for the purchase of the gift card and that did not seem honest and respectful

I hope to improve that and not make such mistakes that discredit the great name of amazoncom
__label__Positive	I dont believe there is a single bad comment to post I wanted to give a gift to someone whether in the same country or not The person is able to choose anything they want an not only one item they are able to choose software or hardware There is no expiry date and best of all the options are endless Made the person I sent it to very happy
__label__Positive	I have purchased these many times  You cant go wrong  Many of my gift recipients use Amazon alot so they really appreciate them

Amazon does a great job at prepping them for gift giving  They offer a nice variety of designs for different occasions

Will definitely use again
__label__Positive	Easy to do  Click pay and print
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	The best gift card anyone can buy  Quick and easy deliveryand right on time in their inbox  The selection of styles pictures colors was above and beyond all expectations
__label__Positive	FYI these cards are activated  LOL I logged onto Panera to check balance and entered the bar code number instead of opening the package and using the card number  Very embarrassing but glad no one was around when called Amazon
__label__Positive	Upcoming Christmas gift for my niece
__label__Positive	not much to say but these were good I bought as gifts and they came the very next day Easy gift for the person who has everything to a store that has everything 
__label__Positive	It was what it was suppose to be
__label__Positive	Best gift  easy to use
__label__Positive	Always love getting the gift cards and the ease of giving
__label__Positive	love
__label__Positive	Cute for a egiftcard
__label__Positive	My family that I gave them to were very pleased
__label__Negative	I was disappointed as when I received itGolden ribbon was not there on one of the box and I was not having enough time to send it back
__label__Positive	Well appreciated  I was told they would use this gift card to start their new babys video library  Probably something they would have put off if they hadnt received my gift card
__label__Positive	Great card Really funny
__label__Positive	I wish there is always 10 off
__label__Positive	Brilliant idea for an overseas gift
Most US websites wont allow you to pay with an English credit card to send a gift card to a relative or friend overseas This was great because we could email gift card over and straight away the recipient can spend their US dollars on their required item Email was also sent straight away so great for last minute gift ideas I will use this again and again Many thanks

__label__Positive	These are great to give as gifts around the holidays or just personal use Keep them in the car for those days that you are low on money
__label__Positive	I purchased this card for my family for the restaurant at college when they visit my granddaughter
__label__Positive	 an easy way to let a friend or family member buy something they want or need especially if they live far away For a special gift DONT SEND a gift card or certificate as it shows a casualness about your relationship
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	I wasnt able to get out and shop  Dont get to see the recipient often enough to know what they want and so the gift card was ideal
__label__Positive	Great value
__label__Positive	Super fast shipping This is the way to go with gift cards Gift card plus free card
__label__Positive	Easy to use
__label__Positive	Another homerun
__label__Positive	Easy and quick
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with this for a gift  The recipients are very happy with it
__label__Positive	These ship quickly and free to you Keep in mind that these are sent blank and the intention is for YOU to fill them out and remail to your recipient Theyre packaged in a stiff cardboard mailer so they dont bend Inside the envelope that ships to you youll find a blank card in the style you ordered with the plastic gift card attached which sometimes has a matching design to your card but sometimes has a generic amazon logo design plus a blank envelope so you can sign the card and remail it in that envelope to whoever If youre REALLY short on time or youre a super Green person an emailed gift certificate is fine If you have a few days to a week these cost the same other than the stamp you need to remail them to your recipient and the cards are good quality and really nice to send and receive
__label__Positive	For those that have a problem finding a gift for their friends relatives etc a gift card from Amazon will do the trick  I was recently invited to a childs first birthday and immediately thought of Amazon because if you cant find it at Amazon you wont find it anyplace else  A gift for all ages
__label__Positive	love the packaging gift box
__label__Positive	This is a great way to help new parents as they can use the gift card to purchase what they really need from Amazon
__label__Neutral	It didnt send the first two times I had to personally send it to make it work Other than that my mother liked it
__label__Positive	Always a winner
__label__Positive	Its gift card not hard to screw up
__label__Positive	Some advice Dont ever wear your real leather boots or your real leather purse when shopping in a mainly veganorganiccrueltyfree store  It doesnt go over well  Not even when you apologize for Forgetting to grab your canvas tote Poor ladybully for me for being too darn poor to afford real leather Pleathervegan now Score
__label__Positive	The only gift better would be cash
__label__Positive	loved the tin
__label__Positive	This was a gift
__label__Positive	Very very useful item for free of cost Great for last minute gifting Love the idea
__label__Positive	Great way to give during the holiday season
__label__Positive	My Grandson was thrilled
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	What can I say  My grandson loved the gift card and the box was an additional bonus to store small objects in
__label__Positive	fun card
__label__Positive	egift card was sent and received with no issues
__label__Positive	love their caramel macciata
__label__Positive	The case is quite lovely
__label__Negative	My friend never received the card and I never received credit  I tried twice  Will never do a electronic one again
__label__Positive	I live in a different state as all of my family members As such I constantly have to fly home or have them fly to me This is the perfect gift for my family members because of that
__label__Positive	Will be used towards the purchase of a camera
__label__Positive	best gift ever cant go wrong AND a smiley gingerbread man  chomp
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Excellent gift I love that Amazon provides a Christmas gift card holder at no extra charge 
__label__Positive	When I first received the Amazon gift card I attempted to load it to my account using my Kindle Touch device  When I wasnt able to do this through the Kindle Touch however I was able to load the Amazon gift card into my account using a browser on my laptop connected via WiFi  Once the gift card was uploaded to my Amazon account I could purchase books through my Kindle Touch using the gift credit in my Amazon account  It would have been nice to provide the ability to load a gift card directly through the Kindle Touch without having to first go through a browser to load it into my Amazon account  It would also have been nice to be able to select my payment method instead of automatically selecting the gift card for any purchase  However I purchased my book using the gift card and have enjoyed using my Kindle Touch ever since

Also I wish the Kindle Touch would provide an Are you sure modal dialog before purchasing a product  It seems too easy to accidentally buy something  However a nice feature is that I can cancel the order right after I purchase but it would be nice to have the confirmation panel before doing so

Overall I enjoy using my Kindle Touch and look forward to purchasing more books through it
__label__Positive	I sent this to my niece  for  her 13th birthday and  she loved it  She redeemed  as soon as she got it  It was a big hit for her birthday  She loves Amazon and often hints at items she wants us to purchase  She was thrilled to have the power to order her own gift
__label__Positive	A great gift
__label__Positive	Only 4 stars because I would have preferred a 1000 gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift fast delivery
__label__Positive	Purchased as a gift  Shipped quickly and made the recipient very happy
__label__Positive	this is good
__label__Negative	Their food sucks and I will never go there again
__label__Neutral	I ordered 2 50 Whole foods gift cards for 100 and one of the cards didnt
work in the store  Can you imagine that how embarrassing
__label__Positive	The tin is really cute I wasnt able to take out the felt lining and gave up pretty quickly
__label__Positive	Great Christmas gift  Much easier to order here than going to the restaurant
__label__Positive	The card was boring but the gift card inside was much welcomed by my son  He loves to shop Amazon as do I
__label__Positive	Amazon Gift cards are always are fast and efficient
__label__Negative	Takes a very long time for the codes to be delivered  I ordered one it worked subsequent orders resulted in all of them being cancelled  No idea why this is happening but it sure is annoying
__label__Positive	usefull
__label__Positive	It is the first time a gave a gift card for my husband I am impressed on how he made it valuable I would never guess that he wanted all the small things he bought with it

__label__Positive	The easiest way to say Thank You  1 Its harder for them to refuse the gift  2 They can always use something from Amazon  3 Its the best way to let them know from afar how much you cared for what they did for you
__label__Positive	The person who got the gift was very happy It was a wonderfull surprise and she bought things for her Kindel
Thank you
__label__Positive	As I stated in the title this is great way to give a Christmas gift especially when you cant get to a store to buy a gift card I have a really decent color laser printer so the end product on card stock was really decent
__label__Positive	Was a great gift Your gift cards enable your customers to pick and make selections of their choice and saves on time
__label__Positive	You can always find a use for an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	This is exact what I needed

__label__Positive	Perfect gift for my audiophile son who lives hundreds of miles away  Delivered on time

__label__Positive	After reading some of the reviews before buying this and another card for a birthday gift I was a little worried it wouldnt come in time I was so excited when they came on time and on the date they were supposed to Even though Minnesota had a blizzard yesterday and bad winds today I would recommend this to anybody

__label__Positive	GREAT
__label__Positive	I like the fast and easy way to acquire a gift card
__label__Positive	As mentioned by other reviewers the value wasnt specified on the cards I had ordered each of mine in the same denomination and just wrote it on the backs so the recipients would know but I imagine it would have been easy enough for them to look up if I hadnt

__label__Positive	It was easy to do and looked fantastic  It added a personal touch to celebrate a dear friends special day
__label__Neutral	The gift card was sent to the recipient with nothing that told them who sent it or why they were getting it As it was they had no idea who sent it and I didnt know theyd gotten it because they didnt mention it not because of bad manners but because they didnt know why they received it
__label__Positive	really nicelooking metal case for the Amazon gift car inside
__label__Neutral	The gift card that came is different than shown but that is fine The frustrating part and why I rated it 3 stars is that you are only able to order up to 4 cards every 7 days Very inconvenient and frustrating when you need to order more for your company and you have to set yourself a reminder after a week to purchase more

__label__Negative	I purchased three of the multipacks containing four cards each  The plan was to save time during the busy holiday season by not having to go into Starbucks to buy gift cards  Plus I would receive them quickly using Amazon Prime  On xmas eve I opened the packages thinking I would quickly put together these gifts for my grandkids One thing I didnt consider was that there would be no gift envelopes to put the cards into so I had to make my own This was time consuming which defeated the purpose of ordering the cards online  But the most annoying thing was that I could hardly pull the cards apart due to the incredibly sticky glue that held them together  Once I got them apart the glue remained on multiple spots on each card  I rubbed and scrubbed to get the sticky mess off but eventually gave up  The cards ended up looking dirty and used and remained sticky  Not the look I was going for as a gift  In the end I would have preferred to go to a local Starbucks to buy individual gift cards
__label__Positive	I would order again  Great Birthday gift for those that live far
__label__Positive	Excellent item Excellent item for a gift Will purchase more for family and friends

__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Hey As you can see above my comment there is no Amazon verified purchase message which means I didnt buy these from amazon but I did from GameStop

And the reviews saying things about buying these from amazon did not have a verified purchase message keep that in mind and the fact most people who do have the message gave it 5 stars and liked it a lot

Item review

GameStop gift cards are a good thing to get gamers of any age with yesterdays games going down You know remember seeing a ad for a game a year ago that games price may have went down alot you can actually find a pretty great deal of games for 25 and if you can use the GameStop power ups card which gives you up to 10 percent off you will get a better deal

If I had one of these I could get a bunch of games

Mag 099
Brutal legend 249
Star Wars the force unleashed 499
Lair 399
Medal of Honor 499
And a few more I have my eye on And remember 10 off For me anyway

This is a great gift for any gamer

__label__Positive	Fast and perfect
__label__Positive	Item is as pictured
__label__Positive	Unbelievably quick efficient and successful
__label__Negative	The recipient of this gift card found that it had ZERO dollars on it making it invalid The card was sent directly to her home from the warehouse The person who sent it out didnt load the amount paid on the card  This was a problem with several card orders  Quite an embarrassment to the gift giver and the receiver when trying to use it  Had the card been properly loaded it would have received 5 stars
__label__Positive	Im agree I really like the product It is helpful in the current conditions of the economy and is a very useful ally to use foreign currency in our country I recommend it Thank you

__label__Positive	I used this to convert a visa gift card into amazon money so I could use it to order something It worked just fine and the transfer went smoothly I can see this being a great gift but make sure the individual is someone who checks their email regularly
__label__Positive	Good deal
__label__Positive	Future egift cards great ideal come on email you print out or not and never expires
__label__Positive	this is the gift to give when you have no idea what they need or want  It is always useful and the receiver can get exactly what
they want
__label__Positive	Easy to order and just what we were looking for
__label__Positive	Pretty cool way 2 give an Christmas present 2 my grand daughter  especially if ur laid up after back surgery

__label__Positive	Came within about 2 minutes and worked perfectly Would definitely purchase again Thanks

__label__Positive	I liked the ease of getting a Christmas present  So simple Will do more next year
__label__Positive	lovely item
__label__Positive	I bought this gift card for myself when there was a Amazon credit promotion for purchasing it  I opted to receive the actual gift card in the mail versus an ecertificate so I remember that I have it  The gift card worked as expected and Im happy with Regis salons as I dont go anywhere else for haircuts
__label__Positive	I was so surprised to see the clever way the gift card was packaged  So was the recipient
__label__Positive	As usual Amazon hit the Ball out of the park with my August 9th gift card to my nephew  The cards are always a hit with the younger crowd  That way they can get what their hearts desire
__label__Positive	Worked great  An easy way to send a birthday gift to friends
__label__Positive	Brilliant idea  Great for grandchildren with kindles Made my gift giving so much easier
__label__Negative	Niece has not been above to use this gift voucher as she cannot load the details onto her Amazon account
She has discussed with Amazon as have I anonymously however the suggested fixes have never worked
Is this a scam because I have paid for something that offers no valuse to anyone and does not perform the function it was origially designed for
Poor form
__label__Positive	Went to the person it was supposed to
__label__Positive	The gift card is always a classic great gift idea for anyone The package came with an invoice that tells you to wait and open the gift box first then the invoice
__label__Positive	I am forever forgetting to mail birthday gifts and cards but with Amazons gift cards I can send the same day since that is usually when I remember it is one of my familys birthday I also have used them for anniversary gifts My kids love that they can get what they want and have it sent right to their home or use the card for Ebooks or apps
__label__Positive	Good gift for people you dont know how to shop for Got this for my mums birthday and she really liked it It works like a Walmart gift card but just for Amazon
__label__Positive	always a perfect gift
__label__Positive	It was great  I will use it again as the stores will only take cash for Amazon gift cards now
__label__Positive	I love that this is an easy gift that anyone can love  Especially when you are short on time and cant go out shopping for that perfect gift
__label__Positive	Absolutely adorable  I got it for my boss birthday and she loved it
__label__Positive	Its a Gift Card I gave it 5 stars because it worked just fine and the picture of coal is humorous
__label__Positive	You guys this was littrally the best at being a card that Ive ever seen anything be  If you are in the market for an Amazon gift card I strongly recommend purchasing this item as its far and away probably one of the most amazing applications of physical amazon credit that real money can buy
__label__Positive	These gift cards are so easy to either print up or email to recipients  I printed one up to send to a shower that I couldnt attend  So convenient to do it any time and from home
__label__Negative	This was given as a gift and the recipient informed me it said it was not properly activated Very embarrassing and unacceptable for this to happen This is useless I hope Amazon will replace it
__label__Positive	great xmas gift
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Negative	I only ordered a 25 gift card and according to my order history this is all that was sent not a 100 gift card
__label__Positive	The birthday cupcake was THE hit Brilliant idea Tx
__label__Positive	gift card was dellivered quickly  food at red lobster was excellent  especially the shrimp cocktail  great crisp shrimp
__label__Positive	Great thing to have for any unexpected birthday party
__label__Positive	Big hit

Thanks
__label__Positive	Gift card was perfect
I have an issue with a previous purchase  The coffee cups did not fit the Kerig machine as stated in the description  I need to send them back but sure how to do them
__label__Positive	You wish big sometimes you hope to land upon a five star that twinkles like an Amazon Prime Wish Big Gift E Gift Card Other times you just e to snail mail it maybe drones it or even ships it oversea it moves it box it pack it just rip rip rip plane it  Whatever your iT oT aT uT eT make sure its BIG whatever that WISH IS
__label__Positive	loved the container made it easier to wrap plus harder to lose in all the wrappings
__label__Positive	Great present
__label__Positive	Easy to send and receiver of gift card thought singing dogs was cute
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for a teenager
__label__Positive	I can buy whatever I want with it 5 stars
__label__Positive	Gift card arrived activated It works All is well
__label__Positive	Just what the doctor ordered
__label__Positive	Who wouldnt love getting an Amazon gift card The card pops up a little bit when you open it It was cute The Grad Hat card box is the cutest they have though
__label__Positive	fun for gifts
__label__Negative	Stay FAR away from Hooters gift cards unless its issued from your local store My daughter bought me 1 online from NY long story short they wouldnt honor it in Fla  saying the card I just printed online has zero balance and Fl chains broke away from corp stores I got stuck w a 32 bill and was unable to resolve it through cust support Its a nightmare unfortunately my daughter was out 50 trying to do something nice for her father
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	If youre going to give a gift card this is the one to give No fees attached All the other ones charge 3  4
__label__Positive	Accepted Internationally
__label__Positive	My kids love these animated cards
__label__Positive	This was a birthday gift It arrived on time and the recipient didnt have any problems using it Amazoncom is as always a wonderful place to shop
__label__Positive	The best gifts you can get
__label__Positive	The youngsters said how cool 
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	was very pleased Cant find anything like this in gift card section of stores
__label__Positive	Fast delivery and I had no problems using it I prefer using a gift card over my debit card because it is safer
__label__Positive	Easy to use and great for making reading purchases for the whole family no matter where they are and whether we have Kindles or iPads
__label__Positive	Another excellent job by Amazon
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	Great food
__label__Positive	Easy to buy instead of going to the store and it worked so 5 stars
__label__Neutral	I didnt realize there would be no greeting inside the card or that it wouldnt be in the envelope  Its ok if its being sent to your home and then you give it out but not for sending it elsewhere
__label__Positive	Always give Amazon gift cards  How can you go wrong  Whoever gets the gift can always find something to buy on Amazon
__label__Neutral	Its a little cumbersome as the cashiers most likely wont know how to process it
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are the best kind of gift card   They are so versitile
__label__Positive	nice
__label__Positive	For a last minute gift and being able to print it out on my printer makes it sooooo much better
__label__Positive	Its a gift carddoes it really require a review The only issue I have with Amazon cards are unless you have Prime the shipping can cost more than the product itself
__label__Positive	Always good
__label__Positive	Choosing this gift card was easy  thoughtful I always depend on Amazon for the exceptional service and choice of products
__label__Positive	Was perfect and came fast
__label__Positive	This is a great option when you need a gift card but dont want it emailed to the recipient You choose an amount and a card style and it arrives really quickly for you to give personally
__label__Positive	Got this for a retirement gift card for a male friend He loved the container It really made the gift card that much more special
__label__Positive	So easy to do Christmas shopping and everybody is happy
__label__Positive	This review is for the Cracker Barrel 2500 Gift card

The card came quick and there wasnt a problem with using it
__label__Positive	Good gift card Good food Whats not to like
__label__Neutral	I thought this was a fabulous idea Until I realized theres a chance the gift receiver may miss seeing the gift card
__label__Positive	My daughter was away at school on the other side of the earth entering intoo finals feeling demoralized I sent her a set of gift cards like this and she loved it
__label__Positive	I just love printable gift cards There are several styles to pick from and you can give whatever amount you want to  Its instantly from your printer no waiting  No lines in the store I use colored paper since I dont  have a color printer
__label__Positive	My grandson Christian Loved this card it is animated and so cute for a birthday suprise
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	what a bargain
__label__Positive	Sister has a Cracker Barrel near her home  Im across country but love to be able to send via email on her birthday  Worked out great
__label__Positive	My wife loves the gift card

__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	My little man Oscar loves this place
__label__Positive	this gift card is for a Christmas gift they requested it so they will love it
__label__Positive	My grandson thought this gift cert was pretty cool
__label__Positive	It was fun to add a picture to the giftcard added a little bit of personality and made it custom too
__label__Positive	The box mine came in was NOT damaged and looked very presentable
__label__Positive	Easy Birthday gift
__label__Positive	My son and I exchange amazon gift card for all special occasions so we each always get to buy the perfect gift for ourselves
__label__Neutral	Having purchased this card for our son who lives in America we realised that we had made a slight mistake in that instead of an email card we had purchased a print card No amount of telephone calls or emails to Amazon enabled us to change the card from print to email The time it took to try and change this was threatening to impinge on his actual birthday so in the end we had to email the code on the print card to enable him to redeem it This from our point of view was not entirely satisfactory as it spoiled this surprise of the card and voucher actually arriving on his birthday
We fully accept that the initial mistake was ours but could not figure out why after phone calls explaining our dilemma someone at Amazon could not have advised us that they would take the necessary steps to right our wrong
Sincerely yours
P J Chandler

__label__Positive	Looking at Amazon for a gift for family far away  I decided on the electronic gift card so as to make it on time and let the kids choose
__label__Positive	Fast delivery No issues

__label__Positive	Well lookie hereIm reviewing a bloody gift card  Well its a card all right  And its a gift

__label__Positive	Excellent I love and will do it again  Thanks Arup
__label__Positive	Best gift to receive and give
__label__Positive	The printable gift cards are fantastic  Theyve saved me many times when Ive had no idea what to purchase for the person  The only reason I gave it a four star instead of five star rating was because often when printing the colors are VERY different than shown  Ive checked my printer and know the problem isnt there  Most of the time it isnt an issue but my friend Scott did give me a funny look when his card was all pinks knowing I care very little for the color  So print on  It will be appreciated by all

Just stuck a little bow on top of each card and put one at each place setting
__label__Positive	how do you rate a Amazon gift card

It was speedy and the giftee gets exactly what they want  Perfect if the person is anywhere between the age of 12  45 especially 1630

__label__Positive	My brother loved his gift card and the box it came in was well received  It arrived on time even though I ordered it late  Thank you Amazon
__label__Neutral	Great gift card very beautiful Only two things I didnt care for One the card isnt plastic its paper Second the bottom of the box has a strip missing so they could scan the gift card without removing it from the box I needed to wrap the bottom half of the box so it wasnt showing the gift card
__label__Positive	My fianc was very happy to receive this surprise gift
__label__Positive	You can never go wrong with an amazon gift card as a present for someone
__label__Neutral	I sent out 2 gift cards unexpected by the recipient  In both cases the email went unnoticed not sure if spam or just deleted until I contacted them a week later to be sure they got the gift  Neither person was aware I had sent them the gift card

Amazon needs to figure out a way to get the recipients attention and avoid Spam filters when a gift is sent

__label__Positive	Easy way to give a gift
__label__Positive	Shipped quickly Card worked perfectly I knocked it down a star as I didnt like the fact that it shipped as an activated Gift Card where if the package went missing I wouldve preferred an email version Personal preference
__label__Positive	received in 2 days  love the gift card package got the snow flake for daughter and santa for son in law  perfect
__label__Positive	With the large variety of items offered by Amazon this is one of the best gift cards available

__label__Positive	Omg the food is amazing and the atmosphere and waiters are great
__label__Negative	I ordered 8 gift cards 25 each and only received 7 in the box plus one more different item that I also ordered  If I could find a customer service option to fix this it would not be such a big deal but after a half hour of searching I could not find a way to contact Amazon about how to report one item missing from an order  I have the serial numbers of the 7 cards I received vs what was expected but found no avenue to contact you  Please help official Amazon team  Now I am out 25 from the missing card and at least 25 more of wasted time
__label__Positive	All I can say is perfect gift when you are not sure what to get I use them ALL the time and never been disappointed
__label__Positive	I loved this and so far I have used twice
__label__Positive	I was worried about getting this because the reviews were saying that it needed to be loaded onto a card to use and you couldnt use it like a normal gift card What the hell are people talking about I went to a Wendys and used it like normal and that was that The Wendys I went to is an old one and they dont have a lot of the new fancy equipment most fast food places do but they do take gift cards and if they do all of them do The Wendys app is basically an optional cardfree hassle You can go to the appandroid store and download the Wendys app and then you may load the cards balance onto the app if you dont want to carry around the gift card in your wallet considering youll have your phone at all times and considering that its 2017 most of us do have our phones on us at all times but thats only if you dont want to carry around a gift card and its quite convenient really
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are always reliable  A quick easy process that  includes all the right options  Takes the stress out of gift giving especially the lastminute kind
__label__Positive	Nephew went berzerk over this delivery method and the card
__label__Positive	I ordered this gift card for my son  I like giving him gift cards so he can treat himself  If I handed over the cash he would use it on bills or other necessities  This way he can enjoy a little treat  I know he loves the Panera soup and half sandwich deal that they have which runs just under 1000 so with this gift card he has about 5 meals  They do make the best Broccoli cheddar soup

He can also use it on their bakery goodsas he loves their bread and cookies  At times hell buy a big loaf of that sour dough bread and Panera is kind enough to slice it up for him

Im going to put this in his stocking this year  I just know he is going to be THRILLED  I am positive my son will put this card to good use  Santa is good
__label__Positive	GO AHEAD SPEND IT ALL IN ONE PLACE

__label__Positive	The amazon gift card was a great gift especially for someone out of the country whom it would be difficult to ship gifts to
__label__Positive	Easy
__label__Neutral	As a result I ordered one or two as Christmas gifts  We were not as enthralled with the restaurant Not many here in Atlanta
__label__Positive	The Amazon gift card is a brilliant idea for that hard to buy for friend They can find pretty much anything here on Amazon so you know theyll get exactly what they want I received them and I gave them Ultra convenient

__label__Positive	gift cardnot much else to say
__label__Positive	Always a great gift for the Amazon shopper Would be 5 stars every time but always have to smooth out a dent or two in the metal gift boxAmazon needs to package better for shipping
__label__Positive	Total Flexibility is what you get from the Gift Card  It is difficult for our thirty something daughter and her husband to come up with something for their now sixty something parents  Rather than give something that may sit idle because of a desperate guess at a gift they have recently given us the wisest gift of all total flexibility As a reader of a book or two a week I can keep my Kindles loaded  Perfect
__label__Positive	The bear is absolutely adorable and so soft
__label__Positive	Since my grandson lives in Germany this was the perfect gift for him  Thanks for providing the service  It was fast and convenient
__label__Positive	What more can you say but Amazon is great AMAZON has everything Instead of buying gifts just get people a amazon card and they can get what they like just perfect1
__label__Positive	Whats not to love Thank You
__label__Positive	I was desperate for a thank you gift and it was delivered in about 1 minute  Great way to send something quickly to someone far away in the holiday season
__label__Negative	118 FOR A 15 DOLLAR GIFT CARD ARE YOU KIDDING

__label__Positive	Success 
__label__Negative	I purchased this gift card for my brothers birthday He text me tonight telling me he and his wife went to Red Lobster to eat and they would not accept the card Oh my goodness I told him I was so sorry I looked on the reviews for this card and several people are saying that Red Lobster will not accept the card 
__label__Positive	Great price at 20 off Would buy again at that price
__label__Positive	great gift idea for teens
__label__Negative	A gift card is always good However this was guaranteed to be delivered by Dec 24th but did not arrive until Dec 29th
__label__Positive	The gift cards worked as expected  Tracking mechanism worked very nicely  It helped me know that they made it to the recipient
__label__Positive	Love the packaging These made fantastic Christmas presents for my kids and grandchildren I wrapped up each one differently with a small gift included and they all just loved them I ended up with a leftover one for me which I tucked in my Christmas tree They are pretty enough to be an ornament a table decoration or a pedestal for a candle If traveling they are really easy to pack

__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	Your card and timely delivery were Great but The ECard was almost deleted as advertising This has happened before So If there is someway to Identify in the Heading that it Truly is a Gift and NOT an AD comeon would be very helpful As the giver of the gift on 2 occasions I have had to have the E cards resent They were not on Amazon however my recipient on this card says she thought it was SPAM at first and almost deleted it

Im just a guy that appreciates your services and I rely on you for its proper presentation
Thank you
Greg
__label__Positive	Its wonderful to be able to send a gift card to a winner of a book release contest when you can personalize the gift with a picture of the book
__label__Positive	Best option for long distance giving 
__label__Negative	I ordered a 50 Amazon gift card for my nephew on December 7th  The tracking of the delivery of the gift card states it was DELIVERED and LEFT ON PORCH but when Christmas came it was not there to give him  Reviewing the Amazon Website for their return policy I am finding the gift cards are not returnable  I never had a bad experience before with any of my Amazon orders I love Amazon but this one is unacceptable  Please tell me how to get reimbursed so I can give him a belated Christmas gift  Thank you

PS The issue really is not with Amazon but UPS  I used them last year to mail gifts to my sisters kids and they truly messed up last years Christmas I paid top  to have those gifts before the 25th and they did not receive those gifts until the end of January I did not get a refund  Just venting but I really want to know what I can do to get my 50 back so I can give him his Christmas gift

__label__Positive	An Amazon gift card was the way to go for my teenage nephew  He loved picking out his own gifts
__label__Positive	Yes my friend LOVED her gift card as a graduation gift
__label__Positive	I really liked this card because it conveyed the holiday atmosphere without using the clichs Were not all in the same club

Thank you
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong with an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	This was so easy and quick for my son who was in Afghanistan at the time  Kindle made it happen
__label__Positive	Quick and easy
__label__Positive	This was better then purchasing in the store and waiting in line to pay for it
I paid on line and the code was sent to my email within 5 minutes ready to print and wrap for a gift
all from the comfort of my own home  Will definately purchase gift cards again this way in the future
__label__Positive	Always an easy way to solve a gift dilemna on a short notice and have a pleased recipient and know there will be no return
__label__Neutral	The gift card was fine but took forever to arrive  It was advertised as Free One Day Shipping while the actual ship time was reasonable it seemed like the order sat in processing for two days and almost missed Christmas because of it  Two days to process a gift card  I have never run into this issue with any other product on Amazon  Normally processing only takes a matter of hours and the product is then shipped  This resellerdepot needs to work on their order processes and systems
__label__Positive	It is what it is
__label__Positive	Always a winner with teens
__label__Negative	Adorable concept but there was a problem with the cards not being activated several times I ordered 9 for my grandchildren and had nothing but problems
__label__Positive	Who doesnt love an Amazon giftcard Shipped to me in one day and came with a nice Christmas card with the card secured inside I was very happy with this purchase
__label__Negative	I purchased this item as a gift When the recipient went to go purchase an item with the card they were told there was a zero balance on card Thanks for not only embarrassing my niece at the register but me as well
__label__Positive	It did come before Christmas Thank you
__label__Positive	Fast shipping and great gift
__label__Positive	Amazon offers so many different items that sending an electronic gift card just makes sense This is the easiest way to cover that gift from afar celebration Thank  you Amazon
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Easy to do and was easy to use
__label__Positive	I bought this for my son for Christmas  He opened the package and immediately logged on to Amazon and used it  He has a very long wish list  
__label__Negative	For various reasons I had  trouble printing the gift card I hope the 5000 has been credited to my account

__label__Positive	Its a Jack in the Box gift card The full value was on the card and it worked well

I did have a situation where the employee at Jack in the Box was poorly trained and didnt realized that he needed to hit another button to process a gift card payment A manager had to come over and confirm that it was a valid gift card So if a Jack in the Box employee says that the gift card is not working just tell them that they need to hit another button to process a gift card Otherwise I didnt have any issues with the gift card

__label__Negative	As I said I got this as a gift to my mother to download kindle books in English We live in Italy and I asked on the chat help several times which amazon I should get the gift card from and they told me that if she was downloading books in English then it would have to be com and that there was no way it could be couk as I suggested
Turns our it WAS couk and theres not much we can do with a com gift card as even if we did buy anything the cost of shipping would outweigh the benefits

__label__Positive	Adorable gift card box with super fast shipping
__label__Negative	I wanted to buy a gift card for a couple on Amazons wedding registry  That means Amazon had their information  it also means it would have been simple for Amazon to put money on their Amazon account and send them a message that they received a gift in X amount from me  But that  wasnt an option  The only option was to send a physical card in a box probably shipped inside another box to be delivered by a vehicle and hopefully not lost or stolen before they can log in and add the funds to their account  It doesnt make sense to me
__label__Positive	Im a big fan of Amazon and its products they make it so easy and give us the customers a pleasant experience thank you

__label__Positive	What it a gift card
__label__Positive	Just as described
__label__Negative	I bought this gift card as a gift and when my friend went to redeem it at panda express they told him the card had no money on it this was a waste of 25 that Ill never get back
__label__Positive	So soft and cute Recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Whats not to like
__label__Positive	Ginger bread men are an old family tradition  This was neat to send to my daughter
__label__Positive	Gif6t cards always good for last minute gifts

__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	I buy these for every birthday and holiday for family and friends that are out of town They are wonderful and they allow them to buy the things they want to get
__label__Positive	Made it so easy will do this againSome times its just to hard to pick the right gift and this works Thank you Donald Teixeira
__label__Positive	brother liked it
__label__Positive	Nice
__label__Positive	I think my brother enjoyed this but I was a little confused as to which currency I should have bought it in I am in Australia and he is in UK
__label__Positive	Card was a gift and so easy to order  use
__label__Positive	Beats the heck out of going to the store and shopping for a card  Prints up very nicely  Looks good
__label__Positive	Beautiful card exterior and interior Great size and I love how shipping was free and it came with an envelope Definitely a good deal
__label__Negative	Purchased this gift card for my brother in New Zealand on his birthday
He was only able to buy books and media from that location using my gift card majority of items not available for shipping to his location Nothing wrong with books and other media however where is the beef

Before purchasing this I should have been warned by a big banner Your brother in NZ will only be able to purchase books and DVDs using this gift card Would you like to proceed
But there was no such banner

At least now I know
__label__Positive	Simple but beautiful and it saved my bacon My wife really liked it especially the amazon gift card that I attached to the  card Thank you
__label__Positive	This is such a simple gift just like any other gift card but its amazon and you get to choose whatever you want So in my eyes this is a great present for all
__label__Positive	It was cute and appreciated by the recipient
__label__Negative	Unable to redeem  the card had not been activated
__label__Positive	My brother is an avid reader and absolutely loves receiving his Amazon Gift Card each year for his birthday  He likes to select his own books and follow the easytofollow directions on the Gift Card as to how to access the dollar allowance awarded

The Gift Card selections are great and allows for more personalization
__label__Positive	Works good at my local Texas road house Super fast delivery as well
__label__Positive	lovely bear thanks Amazon
__label__Positive	As expected
__label__Positive	It worked as far as I know I bought it as a gift for my brother The only issue I had was that it didnt come with the other thing I bought on Amazon but sometimes that happens
__label__Positive	Thank you

__label__Positive	Arrived promptly and worked as expected I bought it as a birthday Present it was already activated and ready for use  I Highly recommend
__label__Positive	What a great fast and convenient gift
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Positive	As usual Amazon lived up to its claims  It was easy to purchase print and send to the recipient  The best part is that the gift card never expires so that the recipient does not feel rushed to find something they want immediately or within a specific timeframe
__label__Negative	My daughter was forced during the payment process on Amazon to use it to pay for an item that was not for herself instead of using a credit card  Why buy it as a gift if it cant be used as the recipient chooses
__label__Positive	great item
__label__Positive	always great buying from Amazon
__label__Positive	Got this for my sister for Christmas and another for her birthday in January Her fav store
__label__Positive	Received ahead of time Perfect
__label__Positive	Good ideal
__label__Positive	This was the BEST Christmas present to my brother and his girlfriendthey were elated that they could plan a well deserved trip away
__label__Positive	 Its was the perfect late cardgift I wanted to send something in a hurry  My grandchildren prefer a gift card from Amazon over any other gift
__label__Positive	Always great food at Cracker Barrel
__label__Positive	Unknowingly this was an awesome buy I just got it off a whim for a good family friend Turns out he loves the company and it was an awesome choice The card came quickly Was a good price and great deal
__label__Positive	What can I say Who doesnt love money on a card lol
__label__Positive	Amazon gift cards are great Their range of products is vast satisfying almost anyone They also sell products for specialized hobbiesinterests and the prices are good as well
__label__Positive	Its a gift card it does what it was made for being a gift
__label__Positive	Id like to receive this wouldnt you
__label__Positive	This was a Christmas gift and the recipient was very happy with it I loved being able to order it and just print it out
__label__Positive	This was really easy and fun to be able to send to my nieces
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Simple  convenient A good gift for any occasion Will consider again for other occasions Able to customize  write a message too
__label__Negative	I ordered this from the UK a week before Christmas as a present for my US relatives but it took 15 days to arrive so was useless as a Christmas present I thought the point of online gifts was the speed of delivery Would not use this method again for overseas gifts
__label__Positive	Nothing better for gift giving  Fits all sizes ages genders
__label__Positive	It is so nice to get the family just what they want
__label__Positive	Awesome gift I love that it can be sent directly to the person
__label__Negative	A poor deal for the money  Can do better with matinees or senior discounts  When I purchased I thought the deal included drink and popcorn  Without add ons save your money
__label__Negative	Gift card was not in Christmas tin and there is where all the problems and phone calls began
__label__Positive	very good
__label__Positive	Always a great gift do they can make their own choice of gift

__label__Positive	Great Purchase
__label__Positive	Good value and prompt shipping
__label__Positive	Very pleased with the service GIFT CARD a very useful and versatile tool allows very efficient gifts
Excellent when you do not know what to give a person
__label__Positive	This was a great and easy way to send a birthday gift to a friend that also loves to read
I received one some time ago and of course I couldnt wait to purchase a gift from my wishlist
__label__Negative	I send a lot of Amazon Cards But I thought Id go the ecard route this time to save a tree Bad idea It never got there Actually this is the second time Ive tried to send an Amazon Card as an ecard And both times it didnt go through I know the email is a good one because that is how I communicated with birthday boy and girl to see if they got it Amazon gets props for walking me through cancelling the ecard and sending a traditional one But I wont rely on their ecard method again Sorry guys
__label__Negative	I bought my elderly aunt a gift card worth 25 They are saying the items i ordered are add ons I just needed some parts and stuff to repair her vaccuum cleaner I did not need anything else Now it wont let me ship unless i buy more items with my bankikg card I just wanted ro purchase parts with the gift card balance and nothing else To use the gift card you need to buy an expensive item with bank card Sounds like a scam to me SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME Dont buy these gift cards Complete scam Believe me when i tell you This keeps happening 25 bucks is 25 bucks and a 100 bucks is a 100 bucks Dont be ripped off SHAME ON YOU AMAZON Im filling with better business after posting this Ps my time is money and thanks for wasting both
__label__Positive	My daughters favorite restaurant It was east and convenient to order the card and not have to go out to pick it up
__label__Positive	I purchased the gift card for my mother to use with her Kindle The print quality was fantastic and looks great inside a greeting card
__label__Positive	Great way to send gifts to grand kids when you live so far away They can pick what they want plus with free shipping
__label__Positive	Mum got a Kindle for her birthday and it was great to be able to give her a gift card to go with it to get her started enjoying and using it
__label__Positive	What a great idea and really personalized the gift cardplus gave the greatgrandparents a chance to see the latest photo

Will definitely use this again
__label__Positive	Great gift for the Kindle reader
__label__Positive	My wife loves this card  She uses it to buy books to download onto our tablet  A lot easier than trying to find the book at the store
__label__Positive	Yummy
__label__Positive	I used my credit card points to get this  So its like getting 5000 of free Sephora merchandise  Hence my 5 star rating
__label__Positive	Great gift tin for all ages
__label__Neutral	Will be 5 stars only if I can simply show them the bar code from my mobile phone rather than use a printed gift card paper
__label__Positive	Cute array of cards and this was perfect
__label__Negative	Sadly misaddressed After learning it was misdirected my fault it was still very difficult to get recredited to my account  successfully resubmit another card Unable to submit original card  replacement was disappointing  Took several tries several days emails  phone calls to Amazon The Amazon representative who finally resolved it was very pleasant  tried to be helpful Sloppy process would have liked more customer service response  maybe a small credit or definitely a stronger  sorry this was so hard  sloppy in administration

I have to admit this is the only problem Ive ever had with an Amazon gift certificate
__label__Positive	This was cute The 500 part is a variable You can probably get one for less In fact I think I got a 500 one for me and a 50 one for a friend The real selling point of this is the heavy duty real life Amazon box the gift card comes in I still have the mini Amazon box because it is just too cute to toss out and it could be used to mail a gift card it is a sturdy box If you have to get an Amazon gift card this is the one I recommend I know that you wont be disappointed
__label__Positive	everyone is always impressed by the box i get when ordering an Amazon gc  i love that they offer it for free when you spend 50 or more
__label__Positive	The bear is cute Love it I may buy more
__label__Positive	Its a gift card and it looked nice in the black box  I just took 2 weeks to get to me so that was a bummer
__label__Positive	Yummy
__label__Positive	Very easy to send a gift card with this process I have used this in the past and will continue to use it
__label__Positive	Great gift tin for gift card  Great service  Thanks  Would do business again
__label__Positive	easy
__label__Positive	My husband loved this gift card It is a fun design and you can never go wrong when giving an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Came quickly and worked as great and is an easy gift fans of this Eatery would appreciate
__label__Positive	Liked it cute kid used it right away I guessany way u could make use depend on a thank you note
__label__Positive	Easy to install and no worries I hope for 10 years
__label__Positive	Great gift idea to purchase goods online and books
__label__Positive	Perfect Xmas gift
__label__Positive	Great way and safe to send gift cards Not have to worry about getting lost or stolen in the mail
__label__Positive	It was so easy and quick the easiest birthday gift ever I would highly recommend it for anyone stuck for ideas of what to buy
__label__Positive	Its the gift my mom wants for every holiday  Love the card and of course the easy gift card  Wish Amazon would come up with a few more new designs andor retire some of the old greetings cards but then again Im a frequent shopper for the gift card so I may be one of the only ones who would like not to have to repeat
__label__Positive	I have a thrilled daughter
__label__Positive	Christmas gift
__label__Positive	Worked perfectly with the exact entered amount

When copyingpasting the code make sure to remove the spaces between the numbers on the express website
__label__Positive	Amazon have made sending giftcards internationally extremely easy and hassle free I very highly recommend amazon to anyone who is having trouble sending loved ones who live overseas gifts and the beauty is that the person can buy whatever they want rather than a gift they might want to return
__label__Positive	Love the ability to send my nieces and nephew a little something for Christmas This is such a great idea to be able to send gift cards and not have to worry about if they will like their gift because they pick it out themselves Genius I will definitely be ordering this again
__label__Positive	Amazon amazing great container that also could be utilized
__label__Positive	great gift cards
__label__Positive	Will be a great birthday present
__label__Positive	did not receive as stated had to call and have a new one sent
__label__Neutral	Given as a Christmas gift I guess it worked out fine
__label__Positive	Very goodwell up to Amazon standards
__label__Negative	Ordered the pink by mistake baby is a boy ordered blue then I saw my basket had 2 gift cards and changed quanity to 1 I assumed I canceled the pink checkout did not indicate pink or blue guess what Luca baby boy got pink ugh
__label__Positive	A fun gift
__label__Positive	This Gift Card was a perfect little gift for an avid reader and new Kindle owner The picture of a young person reading beneath a tree was so sweet and just the perfect image for both the greeting card and the gift card A 10 gift card is hard to find but when 10 is your gift limit it workedout great
__label__Positive	My wife is an avid reader of murder mysteries This card was a great gift for her birthday It will keep her in Kindle books for a long time

As others have said the box is cute too It has magnetic closures
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	Gave as a gift and they said it worked fine when doing a purchase
__label__Positive	Cant beat the service you get when you buy an Amazon gift card  It was a big hit with the recipient too  Thanks Amazon  C
__label__Positive	So easy to buy and print while online Nice card options to give as the gift Would do again because so many things to buy with the card
__label__Positive	Great gift when you dont know what to give
__label__Positive	For an eCard its cute
__label__Positive	It was very quick and useful way to give a birthday gift Amazon is the best way to give a gift
__label__Positive	Was in a hurry for a gift and this just took a few minutes  Worked very well for my needs
__label__Positive	It was a gift for my daughter and she loved the balloons  She can pick the books she wants to read when she feels like it
__label__Positive	I hate not actually picking out a real gift but sometimes these gift cards are exactly what they want
__label__Positive	Good
__label__Positive	iT MADE A VERY NICE CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAWSHE LOVES TO SHOP AT KOHLSi will ask her what she bought
__label__Positive	I purchased as a gift it arrived when it said it would and the recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Perfect gift when unsure what to get
__label__Positive	A gift card for a particular product or service is a great idea for someone who has everything Adding a picture makes the gift card more personal
__label__Positive	My mom loved it  She shops on Amazon a lot but had no idea there were gift cards for it  My mom is extremely hard to shop for so this was the perfect gift
__label__Positive	I bought this for my daughterno moving partsI assume it came with the full 25 on the cardwhy am I reviewing this LOL
__label__Positive	Yay
__label__Positive	2 Christmas gifts down
__label__Positive	This little box is the cutest way to give an amazon card
__label__Positive	Hope you have more gift card sales again soon
__label__Positive	Adorable packaging
__label__Positive	Easy gift to give  no wrapping no worrying if they will like it always a great choice My son in law loved it
__label__Positive	This was a gift for my sister she loved it
__label__Positive	It was a gift
__label__Positive	Easy and convenient  Will use again
__label__Positive	These have been great presents at Christmas and on birthdays I can never figure out what the latest Must have is for my grandkids and these solve that problem Plus since the kids live in other cities I dont have to ship them
__label__Positive	Useful  
__label__Positive	who doesnt like a gift card
__label__Positive	Gift card was appreciated The payment method was much better than an other Company when I initially tried to purchase their gift card
__label__Positive	Process of uploading photo was easy  Minor editing capability that allowed for better photo placement in the frame helped  The recipient was pleasantly surprised  Personalizing an e card any way you can  adds to the experience for both the giver and the receiver
__label__Negative	When selecting the item I had thought it would be great that the kids could colour it in as a personalised gift for their aunty  However as a good portion of the text did not print out this was disappointing to say the least  I contacted Amazon to get this problem rectified only to be told that as it was a print at home voucher they couldnt do anything about it  All they could do was apologise and offer to refund so I could purchase another one  However the refund would take up to a week to get back to me  So while I purchase another one I am out of pocket the money I had spent on the first voucher  To make matters worse the operator was unable to tell me what occured so that when I purchased another one the same issue did not occur  I work in customer service if I offered your reasoning I would be ashamed to do so

I notified the operator I would not be purchasing anything further from Amazon as I just cant trust the service I will receive  I have also passed these comments only my family who are all big kindle users  they were not impressed
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	This was a good time saver I had to get my hubby something for his Bday but hadnt gotten out to get anything so since he now has his own kindle and has read a couple of books I thought the next best thing was to buy him a gift card  I did call Amazon about a gift card and the gal offered to walk me thought an Egift card it was so easy I will do it more often sending a gift to someone
__label__Positive	Great time saver
__label__Positive	It was greatfor my grandson to order his own gift
__label__Positive	Easy
__label__Positive	This was for our grand daughterwho loves to read on her Kendle  She was very excited to be able to make on the spot orders for good books  This item makes buying for teens much easier

A Clark
__label__Positive	Love the design  nice when the actual gift card has nice packaging and not just the greeting card Delivery was very fast  ordered one afternoon and I got it by lunch the next day with everything from Amazon and the recipient having a Kindle  always the perfect gift
__label__Positive	Makes Great Gift
__label__Positive	Excellent means to make gifts
__label__Positive	The recipient got it immediately and was very happy with it  Its avsafe and easy way to send a gift to someone out of town
__label__Positive	Very cool cover compared to a generic gift card Theres also a many covers to choose from to make your gift card more personalized
__label__Positive	Was a steal
__label__Positive	Easy  convenient
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong
__label__Positive	Worked well for what I needed
__label__Positive	Gift cards always great  always deliveredon time  with updates
Only wish there were more animated choices
__label__Positive	It was given and received with joy It was easy to gift Click click and my grandson had his birthday gift several states away
__label__Negative	never received gift cards and amazon wouldnt replace them
__label__Positive	Always a perfect gift
__label__Negative	First tried to order birthday gift card in box  Available in 2500 5000 7500 or other  Tried printing 10000 in other but would not accept  Switched to two birthday gift cards  Received today and both were Kindle gift cards  No one has a Kindle  Tried to return for credit to get the correct card  Said not available for credit  Have email in to try and get straightened out  Hopefully before my kids birthdays
__label__Positive	Gift card to Amazon whats not to love
__label__Positive	Delivered immediately and used code on AMCCOM
__label__Positive	I loved that it was fast  I ordered 3 and in less than 30 minutes they had been delivered
__label__Positive	Easy gift
__label__Positive	Love Gift Cards
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Negative	Dont even take the chance ordering this Amazon has an employee theft problem The claim code is encoded in a QR code on the back of the gift card An employee has to open the box snap a picture and then steal the code at their leisure Then you get to deal with the nightmare that is Amazon customer service

If you have to get a gift card just order the claim number by email Its not worth the hassle of dealing with a used card code
__label__Positive	Well the best gift money can buy that uh you use to buy other things with You know what I mean

I get these for everyone every year for birthdays holidays etc Amazoncom has everything you need so its like giving them a practical gift like cash for a present but WAY classier than stuffing a twenty dollar bill into a stupid greeting card or something

My favorite gift to give AND to get
__label__Positive	This is a easy last minute gift card if you want a goofy but fun ECard get this frog card
__label__Positive	I love that you can customize a gift card with your own photo It makes giving a gift card as a gift a little more special
__label__Positive	No Hassle
__label__Positive	Cant go wrong
__label__Negative	this is the worse thing I ever bought i bought 3 gift cards worth different values for my grand kids When they arrived there was no way to tell
what each card was worth I went on amazoncomredeem and that was uselesswhy would you sell a gift card without a value on it
__label__Positive	The only problem was the gift card did not arrive when originally promised
__label__Positive	Happy Birthday Grandson  Hes a young Amazonian already at age 12
__label__Positive	Always a good choice for someone when you dont know what to give as a gift Let the recipient enjoy shopping and picking out the perfect choice
__label__Negative	I am still waiting for the 10 credit as offered Not happy that I have to put this as comment
__label__Positive	Got this as a gift for my nieceshe loves Sephora
__label__Neutral	Its a Gift Card
__label__Positive	Yes she loved it
__label__Positive	Nice when it comes with a gift credit
__label__Positive	Awesome for when you need it NOW
__label__Positive	lovely bear 
__label__Positive	Exactly what the recipient wanted  I couldnt possibly go wrong with this gift and will use this as an alternative again and again
__label__Positive	thank you got today will put in granddaughters easter basket nice gift thanks amazon
__label__Positive	This was a holiday gift and well received
__label__Positive	Que cagada
__label__Positive	The ease of ordering delivery via computer they got them immediately  they were very pleased and surprised
__label__Positive	very satisfied with this product
__label__Positive	Only problem is it didnt say who it was from but my daughter figured it out
__label__Positive	My sisterinlaw started giving us Amazon  gift cards because we enjoy books  So when she has a brithdaywe send her one too  She is a retired librarian and loves to read so it works for both families  Yea  for the Kindle and it is so convenient and quick to choose a book from Amazon
__label__Positive	I received a 100 gift card for the holidays It was the perfect gift for mesince I was able to pick my own gift I was able to choose a Kindle Touch and love it It is like my family knows exactly what I want every time
__label__Positive	card was a last minute gift for my nephew and now he can buy apps for his parents kindle fire which he just lovesty amazonalso no shipping and card was here in couple of days
__label__Positive	They finally put more meat in
__label__Positive	I love Amazon Gift Cards They are my favorite thing to give No one is ever disappointed by them Tremendous purchase
__label__Positive	My wife really enjoyed the design
__label__Positive	Super easy and useful
__label__Positive	Met my expectations
__label__Positive	Always happy with gift cards  Always on time 
__label__Positive	Work great easy to download
__label__Negative	Purchased this card while on sale during Christmas  Went to use it and was told that there was 000 balance and that it had been redeemed the week before over 3000 miles from where I live and am located  Contacted Applebees they told me to contact Amazon  Contacted Amazon they told me to contact Applebees

EDIT I still rate this gift card a 1 but I have to give Amazon credit for responding to my concerns  After a couple of phone calls between me and Amazons Customer Service they have provided me a 40 Amazon credit to compensate for this purchase  This is a very satisfactory solution to my issue and I am really happy that even when things dont go exactly as I had hoped Amazon is willing to make the attempt to make things right for their customers
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Gift cards are great I use alot of them for many people especially for the teens and men as these seem to be the most difficult to purchase gifts they would like
__label__Positive	really cute containers nephews girlfriends loved them
__label__Positive	Arrived right on it Easy  great gift idea
__label__Positive	so much better than trying to figure out a present and then mailing it to someone best way to send gifts and they can pick what they want
__label__Positive	Easiest birthday gift I ever shopped for  The recipient was pleased with it too After all what can you not get at Amazon
__label__Positive	We love these My wife uses them all the time to order books for her kindle and we give them as gifts also
__label__Positive	gift
__label__Positive	Very good product and quality   Was exactly what I expected
__label__Positive	delivered on door step no signature kinda weird
__label__Positive	So this was bought for a Holiday Work function as a give away and it was a hot item I didnt realize how many colleagues shopped on Amazon Needless to say this got snatched up quickly It came already boxed with a bow and I didnt have to wrap it
__label__Positive	I love this because I am a lazy lazy person  Just buy this bad boy and the only thing you think about is how much to spend  Besides that the person you give it to will probably be happier anyway
__label__Positive	Easy to purchase Delivered the next day Gift recipient loved it Would get another one in a New York minute
__label__Positive	I love the cute design of card holders
__label__Positive	Not sure what to give someone Let them pick their own present Its the best way
__label__Positive	You can never go wrong with a gift card These are emailed to the recipient very quickly I received an email when the gift card was received and I can log in to my Amazon account to see if it was redeemed
__label__Negative	The card with full balance didnt work at the box office even after trying it several times and at two different registers
__label__Positive	Ordered 16 for employees They came shrink wrapped A few of the bows and bells were missingbroken
__label__Negative	When I ordered a Safeway email gift card thru Amazon there were no disclosures about specific conditions in order to redeem it  There should have been because the only options were to 1 print the email card or  2 use Google Pay  The recipient of this gift card had not used Google Pay before but found out that it only works with Android phones and NOT her iphone And not having access a printer at the store she was also unable to print it  This gift card which was supposed to be helpful turned out to be nightmare  It should be a straightforward process and that not being the case Amazon should make the process for using the gift cards they sell very clear Ive always been pleased with Amazon but this is unacceptable
__label__Positive	Complete satisfaction
__label__Positive	who doesnt love an amazon gift card  This one prints nicely
__label__Positive	gift cards delivered to your house smart move
__label__Positive	Cutest gift card box Ive seen Absolutely love it The top of the box is magnetic and stays closed
__label__Positive	How can you go wrong
__label__Positive	A simple and fun gift for the hard to shop for person Allows the recipient to purchase something they need or something just for fun
__label__Positive	Simple and easy way of sending a birthday gift electronically
__label__Positive	Recipient loved it
__label__Positive	Works great Just show gift card on your phone and youre all set Not a fan of Papa Johns but cant beat getting free pizza
__label__Positive	Easy to shop for and buy  It fulfilled several items on their Santa list  So sad that I cant surprise them with toys anymore  Not Amazons fault
__label__Positive	it is very nice
__label__Positive	And a GREAT gift that will be used  As we get older finding a gift that we want becomes more difficult because weve acquired the things we want  This was such a great ideasomething she likes and doesnt do very often something shell use and something that doesnt need storage space in the house or garage
__label__Positive	Very convenient especially for lastminute ideas
__label__Negative	The code they sent didnt work  Hassle to get a refund
__label__Positive	good product  arrive as advertised  arrived on time  good seller  thanks
__label__Positive	Ordered this gift card on a Monday got it Wednesday morning It came in one of those brown padded envelopes but the packaging for the actual gift card box was a smooth design well made cool looking black box instead of a gift card in an envelope with an orange bow on it It was pretty easy to open Though when you order the gift card the site will have a field to put a description or some words like Happy Birthday or Congratulations these words will not go on the box or gift card It is just printed on the invoice that comes with the gift card
__label__Positive	MUY BIEN
__label__Positive	This gift card was a perfect option for my hard to shop for father They have many great styles to choose from Easy to use
__label__Positive	Simple and easy  printed just fine
__label__Positive	I always like gift certificate as nice as money  it was a very nice surprise and will be enjoyed  I am sure
__label__Negative	For the past hour I have been trying to buy a kindle gift card  I have used valid credit cards and gotten the same message repeatedly that there is some problem and that I need to change the way I order this  I have been ordering items from Amazon for several years and have used the same cards all the time  But now they are refusing telling me to try later  I am thoroughly disgusted with this mickey mouse operation
__label__Positive	Great gift for my daughterinlove
__label__Positive	Just what the recipient wanted
__label__Negative	Very disappointed that was not able to email my nephew with this Christmas gift card with no option to change the delivery method This portion of the order process should be made much more user friendly Unfortunately because there was no option for your customer to change the method of delivery to an email address once a print option was selected took me three days to configure a way to email my nephew his gift card because your system did not give me that option to send it also by email
What would be good is that an option to print the gift card to mail to the person you are gifting and then also to email them to let them know that they have a gift card coming in the mail
__label__Positive	I loved the convenience of paying for this online and printing it at home
__label__Positive	Very pretty box that is perfect for the holiday season without being specifically designated for any religious holiday  The box presents beautifully as a gift  And who doesnt like an Amazon gift card to purchase anything the recipient desires
__label__Positive	Its the cutest thing ever
__label__Positive	Super cute
__label__Positive	Actually I bought my Christmas photos through Shutterfly this year  Im very happy if I bought them via Amazon
__label__Positive	Perfect Easy Gift 
Got it as quick as i order it 
Receiver of the gift card able to use it immediately very convenienceas a gift 
__label__Positive	Its great to be able to just email this and send them no fuss no problems just pick a nice card and send
__label__Positive	Its Purrfect
__label__Positive	This was gift for Christmas to my son He made good use of it and I would highly recommend Easy to purchase and redeem
__label__Positive	Whats not to love about getting an amazon gift card It is an easy great gift to get or give You know they the receiver will find something to buy from AMAZON I dont know anyone that doesnt love them I love the fact that I can send last minute and sending it digitally is the best
__label__Positive	good
__label__Negative	I purchased as a Secret Santa premise for giftee Only to find out my name DOES show up even though I had included in the actual gift card it was given anonymously Totally not cool Defeats the purpose and I was extremely upset that confidential info my name was shared so freely
__label__Positive	Easy and convenient
__label__Positive	Egift card
__label__Positive	great idea for christmas or anytime
__label__Positive	Its a gift card so it is always what you expect
__label__Neutral	Package was flimsy so gift card package was bent
__label__Positive	These wee stocking stuffers and the kids loved them
__label__Positive	I basically apply these credits to my account as a form of layaway on preorder video games and whatnot Always receive the email immediately No complaints
__label__Positive	I frequent Applebees  could not pass up the offer for free 10
__label__Positive	Always dependable  Thank you
__label__Positive	This was a last minute gift idea for family Not quite nextday delivery as promised on the site but pretty fast for this time of year nonetheless 
__label__Positive	excelent product
__label__Positive	It was fast and easy
__label__Positive	The Amazon Gift Card is a good solution for a last minute gift  Sometimes I forget about birthdays especially for family that reside far away  It take a about five days to send a git to them thru the postal system  If I get in this bind and cannot think of something they would like I send an electronic Amazon Gift Card  Its quick and my relatives are savy with Amazon so it makes for a satisfying gift even if it is a little impersonal on my part
__label__Positive	It certainly helped on a short notice invite to a birthday party
__label__Positive	I was delighted to try a new green tactic for teacher gifts this holiday season  They loved seeing a fun photo of their student with his personalized holiday wish  Everyone can find something they need on Amazon so it was a big hit
__label__Positive	perfect gift for someone who has everything
__label__Positive	I love using this to order my Kindle books with my gift card  Works perfect I would recommend buying books with a amazon gift card
__label__Positive	The gift card did not require postage to mail and my sister and brotherinlaw can choose their books for their Kindle and Kindle Fire themselves
__label__Positive	I love that Amazon offers you these adorable gifting options for free Thanks amazon
__label__Positive	On time and welcome  A good distance gift
__label__Positive	Excellent
__label__Positive	Love the gift cards in the pretty tins Add a little gift bag and piece of tissue paper and put it right under the tree
__label__Positive	Neat packaging 
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly and exactly as expected
__label__Positive	I bought this gift card for a friend She is so awesome but I never know what to give her She loved it I will be sending her one for her birthday
__label__Positive	It was just what I wanted for a birthday I was looking for something different and this worked perfectly
__label__Positive	worked fine arrived in minutes
__label__Positive	This was a gift for someone else They had no complaints
__label__Positive	Introduced my little cousin to my favorite store and successfully got her Bday gift to her ON her birthday
__label__Positive	Great idea  I gave this to a friend overseas to avoid the complications of transferring foreign dollars  She is using it to order books online
__label__Positive	awesome gifts for my BFF
__label__Positive	A perfect gift  Right size and color 
__label__Positive	Sometimes you just dont know what to get someone and honestly this is the best option Amazon has millions of different items from home to clothing and much more This is the safest and best way to treat someone on a special occasion because you know they will order something that they actually need or want
__label__Positive	Whats not to like about a 5000 gift card  from Amazon
__label__Positive	Sometimes its hard to know what to get the grandchildren like to shop so this makes it easy and they have fun  I like the balloons on it as soon as they see it they know and Im sure smile
__label__Positive	Buy these every time I see them on sale  Great deal
__label__Positive	My niece got her gift card and was pleased  i was happy as it was easy and worked like it was supposed to  I had read a few negative reviews so I was concerned that she wouldnt actually get it  She did receive it immediately and I would do it again  I live in SC and she lives in CA so it was a great way to send a gift
__label__Positive	I was really surprised by the quality of the card  Originally thought I would be sending two birthday cards but after I received the gift card I realized two cards would not be necessary  great surprise
__label__Positive	Good packaging
__label__Positive	Who doesnt like an Amazon gift card  Adorable tin too
__label__Positive	Great food
__label__Positive	worked out great and received quickly and nice features
__label__Positive	GOOD TO GO
__label__Positive	Nothing to say  The best gift 
__label__Positive	As described Immediately email delivery Started using the same day worked just fine
__label__Positive	Nice presentation  A surprising way to give the Gift card
__label__Positive	This is a excellent choice for any ocasion specially to country with dollar regulations I highly recommend it It can be used for you or as a gift to people you dont really know or hard to gift
__label__Positive	I love how easy these are
__label__Positive	had an issue with the email delivery and had to resend it a couple of times  I will use gift card again
__label__Positive	My granddaughter just turned 10 and for her birthday her parents set up her own email so this just was a great gift from her grandparents  She LOVED it  And I wrote a little poem on the Birthday email to go along with it
__label__Positive	Great quick gift
__label__Positive	Its a gift card so yea
__label__Negative	Gay  Lesbian Gift Cards  Sad Very Sad  100 starts
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	Better than cash because it has the Amazon logo on it  It made sure my giftee didnt use it on bills or something like that so they truly got a gift
__label__Positive	I bought this instead of trying to figure out what someone wanted for christmas  I was just right  Ill do it again
__label__Negative	Didnt work from the moment I opened the box
__label__Negative	I purchased a 40 card as a GIFT  When the recipient tried to use it the card showed that it had a balance of 0 This was quite embarrassing  I then noticed that purchases on my account had been credited with 40 yet I had never used the code printed on the gift card  This was supposed to be a gift  instead it turned out to be a very awkward situation
__label__Positive	Love Love Love the Amazon printable gift cards I am a notorious last minute gifter I never have time or patience to go out and shop I know my gift recepient will be able to get just what they want with this gift card
__label__Positive	The kids loved it There mother on the other hand no so much I call that a Win Point Dad
__label__Positive	Shipped super quickly Already loaded and had no issue using them I ended up using these myself because of a cancelled event but I had no issues with these cards
__label__Positive	GOOD
__label__Positive	Bought this as a gift
__label__Positive	good product
__label__Positive	this was a gift
__label__Positive	Came quick  I guess old people like Talbots Not my thing
__label__Positive	Gift card in a gift box

__label__Positive	I saw this in the lightening deal for christmas deals on amazon prime Of course I jumped on the opportunity to buy this as a gift for 20 instead of 25 Wish I could have bought more than 1  
__label__Positive	The kids love to go shopping on Amazon This was the best gift ever because it made gift shopping painless for me
__label__Positive	It is a cute idea and shipping was free

__label__Positive	The ease with ordering and the joy of the recipient are unmatched Great gift idea
__label__Positive	I ordered several gift cards for Christmas this year  I could not believe they actually arrived the next day with free shipping  The tin gift boxes were a great way to present the cards
__label__Positive	Gift for family member
__label__Positive	It came with in 2 days in my mailbox and I love the look of my gift card
__label__Positive	Just the right gift for anyone with such a wide selection for the receiver to choose from it feels good to give the perfect gift
__label__Positive	I ordered 1 50 gift cards to give out as gifts for XMAS I was shocked to find that I received the boxes without the cards I then proceeded to chat with an Amazon rep who said they would replace the item Then I received an email stating that since they were cashed immediately they couldnt do anything Stroke of bad luck YES Nothing I guess I can do since anyone could say that they were missing the cards What bugs me is that there is no security procedure to protect the buyers from incidents like this
__label__Positive	Needed a present for 93 year old aunty who loves her Kindle What else could I get Easy to organise and send
__label__Positive	Nice to have a 21 discount

__label__Positive	Great card I think the email card is faster than I expected and my friend will feel happy to received it
__label__Negative	BUYER BEWARE I purchased 14 10000 cards directly from Amazoncom in 0218  The gift cards came adhered inside of Thank You cards which were tucked into envelopes  Each of those was then in an Amazon sealed outer envelope  The fourteen cards were then in a sealed opaque envelope and that was in a sealed Amazon box  My point being the claim codes were not visible once they were shipped to me  I handed these out to my employees in appreciation  Over the past week 2 employees tried to use their cards and they were already redeemed  That was the first round of hours worth of calls to Amazon support  They credited one back to my account which then I had to give my employee 100 to replace the card  The other one I received an email that they were unable to help me because it had already been redeemed  I still had 3 unopened cards locked in the safe in my office  These had never had the outer envelopes open  Both came up as already redeemed 3 more hours with support and I finally reached a supervisor that understood the issue  The claim code compromise had to occur before they shipped since they were still in the sealed package  She took a list of everyone I had given the cards to looked up the serial numbers I had purchased and found that 5 of them appeared to be fictitious name accounts  She again had to escalate me to the gift card department who again answered me with a stock email stating they cannot do anything because they have been redeemed and I will have to contact the bank that issued the card ACI which is part of Amazon  No phone number given  The link to contact them takes me right back to customer support to start this whole process over again  50000 of worthless cards thats my reward for being smart enough to order them direct rather than buy from a grocery store
__label__Positive	Gift cards work great for me
__label__Positive	Bought it for dad was too lazy to go to the store again as i forgot to grab one earlier Came exactly as described with no damage Thanks
__label__Positive	Exelent

__label__Positive	Cant go wrong with a gift card
__label__Positive	Quick easy and painless Id do this again in a heart beat
__label__Positive	It was a gift for my sons birthday who lives in Wyoming I had already purchased a birthday card and the printed version visa card worked out great I just enclosed it in my card and mailed it to him He has already used it with no trouble

__label__Positive	Zarchy has recounted wonderful tales of trying to do business as usual in other parts of the world  Every State Department employee should read this book for insights into other cultures theiir hierarchical customs and unexpected roadblocks from assumptions about behavior and expected relationships  From the matrix of rules and regulations in authoritarian China to preservation of Face in Japan to chaos and curruption in India patrician formality in France precision in Germany etc this exposure to real situations is better preparation than any academic course in international relations And funny haha too
__label__Positive	You cant go wrong with an Amazon gift cardespecially if you are giving to someone who listens to books while they drive

__label__Negative	I wanted a 20 gift card A message popped up that if I applied for a credit card they would charge me 20 but make it for 30 Got the gift card sure enough 30 and yep you guessed it got my statement and they charged me 30 WOW what a big bunch of garbage Yes I bought other gifts there as well But not likely to buy any more Talked to a lady on line she said I need to provide them with where that promotion was located Hummmm lets see amazoncom gift card section Granted its only 10 but its a rip
__label__Positive	Made a great gift
__label__Positive	Perfect Gift for my son just what he wanted
__label__Positive	Great product
__label__Positive	I love this way of getting Amazon Gift cards its fast and efficient and easy to remember where it is stored for remembering who and how I received it I love the design of the card
__label__Neutral	Stayed at a not so good place Pay a little more and stay at a hotel
__label__Positive	They work great as gifts for people who are normally hard to shop for I bought several and gave them to couples I also kept a couple on hand for last minute gifts for people who may show up with a gift for you that you werent expecting  Who doesnt like going to the movies
__label__Positive	Fantastic Highly recommend
__label__Positive	5000 gift card for 4000cant pass that up
__label__Negative	A great gift for anyone who has rudimentary computer skills  Not so much for ones 91 year old motherinlaw who asked how the hell do I work this  Thank you Amazon for making the exchange so I could get her a Visa Gift Card which she could figure out how to use
__label__Positive	works as expected
__label__Positive	My son loved it he ordered the perfect gift on his birthday
__label__Positive	The gift card came in as aspected It made it to my house without any promblems No tampering no rips and inside the package the contents were in great condition
__label__Positive	The price was right and perfect for someone who doesnt know anything about good restaurants  Also I dont really like who I gave it to so its a winwin for me
__label__Positive	Couldnt be easier or faster
__label__Positive	love it
__label__Positive	It was exactly as described
__label__Positive	Thank you for the convenience that Amazon offers when gift giving  My daughter lives across the country  Really added that personal touch DHammond
__label__Positive	The fact that these came in steel boxes is very nice  You dont have to worry about transferring them to another gift box  The card number can be read through a clear opening on the reverse side so no need to even remove the card from the box  The card is paper though not like a credit card
__label__Positive	Was fun for birthday gift
__label__Neutral	I ordered the gift card and requested delivery on August 2 This was confirmed by email A couple of days later Amazon informed me that the gift card had been mailed to the receipient on July 31 I was not happy about this change
__label__Positive	Its a gift card to Bass Pro Shops awesome Get your fish on
__label__Positive	My daughterinlaw like myself is a rabid reader She has a Kindle and I decided that rather than buying her a gift card to a bookstore I would give her an Amazon gift card This was a great decision She had more selections to choose from at a better price and since she is frequently on Facebook it was delivered to her right away and she had already used it before I even knew it had been delivered Im doing this for most of my gifts from now on
__label__Positive	By purchasing the gift card I made someone happy  Plus I received a 10 gift card from Amazon
Not a bad deal
__label__Positive	Fast easy and another task done Thank you so much for making busy days easier Will come back in furture
__label__Positive	it was delivered in the right amount of time
__label__Positive	I was apprehensive  about sending this gift card to my niece for her new kindle fire  After reading reviews about ALL the problems the recipient has redeeming the gift  My niece lives in another state so I went ahead and purchased it for her I had no problems at all and she had no problems redeeming it all went smoothly and she was happy on her end
__label__Positive	Pretty packaging and it makes a great gift for a loved one or your kids teacher
__label__Positive	You know My sister tipped me off on this gift card thing  I was always against it becaues it seemed like a lazy way out  I always enjoyed picking out a gift but I must admit I was not that good at itmost of the stuff I picked outended up in a drawer somewhere

But here is what changed my mind when my sister told me how much fun it is to pick something out

So actually it is like a double gift  They get the giftand they enjoy the shopping

Un beliveable  Merry Christmas
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	Buying a gift card from Amazon is the perfect gift and they give you a cute little box or card for free This card is adorable and I know my son will love it
__label__Positive	Not really much to say I ordered this and it arrived the next day The receipient was pleased and the card worked as it should
__label__Negative	it never printed  i called customer service twice and was to receive a credit  it did not show up on my credit card bill yet as a credit although the charge certainly did

i was very disappointed  i have purchased numerous gift cards in the past and never had any trouble  thank heavens the drug store has amazoncom gift cards although i prefer the printed ones
__label__Positive	Very convenient
__label__Positive	I absolutely love giving gift cards to Amazon Friends  Family can find anything they are looking for at the best prices
Gift cards are my choice to give as a Perfect Gift
__label__Positive	Excelente
__label__Positive	Nothing is easier than gift cards Wish I had realized I was choosing a pattern that wasnt clear to me This was a Christmas gift and I would have preferred a Christmas picture
__label__Positive	This arrived quickly and had the amount loaded to the card
__label__Positive	I love this idea of egift card from amazon it rescued me I was getting quite late to ship a birthday present to my friend who lives in States and this gift card arrived within minutes Super
__label__Positive	It was a friends birthday and I wasnt able to go shopping for a gift I purchased an Amazon gift card and sent it to her via email Its a simple and quick way to give a gift
__label__Positive	It made buying a gift nice and easy and the parents can choose what they need
__label__Positive	Loved the box I will get all my amazon gift cards from them
__label__Positive	Shipped quick and as described
__label__Positive	Its so easy to buy an Amazon gift card online and people appreciate giving them as gifts  True they are available in supermarkets and drug stores but getting them online allows you to choose the amount you want and the design  People love getting gift cards and theyre so much more convenient than the old gift certificates and much more cool than cash
__label__Positive	the perfect gift for a 20 child with a family of their own My  grandchild loved watching the video too
__label__Positive	Love them
__label__Positive	Amazon you are always there to find the perfect gift
__label__Positive	My niece appreciated it
__label__Positive	It works great
__label__Positive	This was purchased for a relative by request
__label__Positive	Always a Great GiftLove itNow I can get more books to read in my KindelThank you thank you thank you
__label__Positive	My GrandDaughter thought it was cute
__label__Negative	Id give this 0 stars if I could I bought it for my son so he could upgrade to the Spotify student account for 499 per month which includes Hulu I thought is was a great way to provide entertainment while away at collegeunfortunately Spotify will not let you use a gift card for the student subscription only premium which is twice the price They want a credit card to bill monthly which I will not provide I will be reasearching alternatives for next school year this is ridiculous
__label__Neutral	Three stars since the top and bottom halves of the card separated in transit This obviously doesnt affect the card usage but it was a bit annoying to not be able to present the card with its value attached
__label__Positive	Great
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	We love the option of being able to print out your own personal gift card and say whats in your heart It was sooo much more intimate than a store bought card with a plastic gift card inside and definitely gives that feeling to the receiver of a homemade card which you took the time to make  just for them  It was so easy to create  only took minutes to print out Weve used this option several times and I must say this is by far my favorite way of giving a gift card Thank you Amazon  you guys rock
__label__Positive	I loooooooooove these email gift cards  I would love to say that I actually buy them for other peoplebut most of the time I just send them to myself  I like that I can buy one and complete all my purchases in one big bulk  The one click buy on Amazon ticks me off because I end up having all these transactions on my credit card and I just found it so annoying  So the Gift Card was the perfect solution to my little problem You get the email right away and can start buying in minutes  Ive become addicted and have started buying two cards a month now  Which my husband swears I need an intervention for
__label__Positive	Very adorable and easy to use
__label__Negative	doesnt work at all you guys are awful for embracing people with this fake e card DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WILL EMBARRASS YOU IN THE RESTAURANT ITS HIGHLY KNOWN FOR NOT WORKING
__label__Positive	No problems Came on the exact delivery date amazon promised
__label__Positive	Makes for a quick easy gift  I bought it because Amazon was offering a 10 discount if you bought a gift card  So I bought a gift card for a friend and got a 10 credit from Amazon  Good deal
__label__Positive	Thank you
__label__Positive	It was a perfect gift for a granddaughter who has a wish list on Amazon and is into Dr Who
__label__Positive	Arrived early Happy Birthday to me
__label__Positive	So easy and people are happy to get them
__label__Neutral	I bought the gift card which is exactly what I thought it would be because I received an offer for a 10 promotional credit  I was supposed to receive this via email by 101513  So far I havent received it  Since this offer came directly from Amazon I wouldve thought theyd follow through Disappointed
__label__Positive	Super cute
__label__Positive	Its a gift card its all good
__label__Positive	Superior to most of the designer junk thats out there and costing a lot more money
__label__Positive	worked great
__label__Positive	Perfect gifts for that special someone or even a friend if you dont know what to buy them Much easier than trying to pick out something they probably exchange anyway
__label__Negative	I suppose to get 10 gift card with my order  Where is my 10 card
__label__Positive	She got my gift
__label__Positive	Awesome food
__label__Positive	Adorable gift card idea And it came in the next day 
__label__Positive	what can I say its a code that lets me get stuff ro free loved spending itbought the wife some perfume and myself the Diablo III collectors edition
__label__Positive	Arrived quickly they were great gifts
__label__Positive	Youd have to be crazy to not love this
__label__Positive	Always a good gift for any age
__label__Positive	Exactly as described and easy to print out
__label__Positive	came in record time and was used by my son to pay for college books  It is a great way to use money wisely
__label__Positive	good
__label__Neutral	I chose this rating because no message was written in the cards that  I put online I was disappointed that our employees didnt receive the personal message because they had no idea where it came from
__label__Positive	Great gift
__label__Positive	A gift card is always a perfect gift This card arrived the next day
__label__Positive	I hide these on a small Christmas tree to make it a fun search for guests I also switch up the gift cards with various retailers Dont forget to add gift tags  The guests enjoy it and find other treats along the way
__label__Positive	There are a few reasons I used a gift card It is more difficult for me to shop at the store I also prefer allowing the receiver choose there own gift when possible The money card is a perfect choice Amazon has something to make everyone happy
__label__Positive	Nice gift
__label__Positive	Love it and it was delivered on time
__label__Positive	Just a little thank you gift for my boyfriend that was there when I needed him he was in shock I gave him this
__label__Positive	All good
__label__Positive	Perfect
__label__Positive	What a wonderful idea to be able to purchase then email a gift card  I was invited to a baby shower that I would not be able to attend and this was a perfect solution
__label__Positive	Im one of those guys that leaves home with a list of things he is shopping for dont ordinarily buy a substitute but last year at Christmas time I had one guy I wanted a gift for and couldnt think of anything before I left to do my shopping thing  I didnt see anything he didnt already have while I was shopping  I commented to my wife that I was stumped on getting the guy something  She came back with You mean Amazon doesnt have it  When I called up Amazon on the computer the first thing that caught my eye was a gift card  Aha  problem solved  Let him do the shopping  It worked so now thats what he gets every Christmas from now on
__label__Positive	Whats not to like about giving or receiving a WF gift card  Excellent service from AMAZON no less than what I expected
__label__Positive	easy to print  send not sure why a certain amount of words are needed  i have nothing more to say
__label__Positive	Just what was needed
You used to have something available through facebook is that still available
__label__Positive	Super fast delivery mine have always arrived within 2 minutes of purchase
__label__Positive	good
__label__Negative	I would rather have had a cardboard or plastic gift card  I feel like it is rather cheap Is this okay
__label__Positive	Convenient
__label__Negative	Note Airbnb gift cards dont work on long term stays which is kinda ridiculous
Its like if McDonalds decided that their gift cards dont work on Big Macs cause our margin is razor thin on that product
Dont be like me and think you can buy up a whole bunch and combine for a long term rental
Luckily I caught myself after buying only one card and I travel enough to be able to use that up pretty fast
Only get these if you or the person your giving to is planning one or more stays shorter than 28days
__label__Positive	Great gift card worked perfectly
__label__Positive	It is a great gift card
__label__Positive	a good innovative method of gifting without hassle with instantaneous a few minutes delivery time no more worrying if the gift is good or useful or suitable for an occasion gifting cash is right way to go I am glad I have used it now once and know how to do so and shall continue in future too thanks amazon
__label__Positive	Cant wait for a get away
__label__Positive	Mom loved it  loves her Kindle app  shes 91 years old  
__label__Positive	Product as advertised Would deal with again
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Very easy to buy and deliver  Muy fcil de comprar y enviar
__label__Positive	My husband is an avid fan of Steak n Shake so I gave this to him for Fathers Day He loved it I loved it too because I got this on one of Amazons Lightning Deals and only paid 20 for the 25 card This is like a free meal for him
__label__Positive	A great gift idea
__label__Positive	Perfect gift for anyone
__label__Positive	Very convenient way for a grandmother to treat her granddaughter to healthy meals
__label__Positive	I use amazon gift cards because it is extreamly convienent and the party receiving them likes them very much  I purchased many cards and they all were put to good use

Always timely delivery
__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	Was a cute addition to the The Saran Wrap Ball Christmas Party Game
Thanks
__label__Positive	Item as described
__label__Negative	The envelopes they sent dont fit the cards So watch out for that
__label__Positive	My father is an Amazoncom junkie Its hard to know what to get him because he loves to shop around before making a purchase This year instead of hinting and waiting for a clue I treated him to a Gift Card and posted it to Facebook Best idea ever While I do love the pleasure of making a purchase myself this worked out just fine
__label__Positive	Always a pleasure to receive
__label__Positive	Is there a better gift than an Amazon gift card
__label__Positive	Great gift card It preformed exactly as expected I wish Panera still had the Asiago roast beef sandwichif they did I might actually eat there againhopefully the exec who made that bad decision has been fired 
__label__Positive	Gift Card facilitates our work in US currency transaction
You save us dollar no expiration dateas well as buy different items without cumbersome steps
I recommend it all the people who purchase  by Amazon
__label__Positive	Eh its a gift cardwhat exactly can I say
__label__Negative	Received one of these for Christmas last year Thought wed go see a movie the other night 25 should cover two tickets no problem right Wrong We had to give them our credit card info to pay a wonderful 058 thanks to convenience fees of nearly 10 the cost of the already kinda pricey tickets Oh and no mention of this at all before hand Not particularly a fan of giving out my credit card info especially in order to use a gift card last minute Especially not to pay a fee that may borderline on them losing money seeing as the credit card company charges them a processing fee The whole thing reeks of absurdity Oh and dont bother asking for a 058 fee discount they have no interest in you being happy with their service 
__label__Positive	it worked
__label__Positive	Very easy for my wife to order and for me to print Nice gift idea so they can get what they need and have it delivered to their house Recommended
__label__Positive	These make a great gift for anyone who likes to go to the movies They can use them at any regal cinema for tickets AND snacks at the snack bar
__label__Positive	This was really a lovely ecard to send with a gift certificateI liked it and my husband liked it so much he saved it on his desktop to run for funit supplies you with memories of Midsummer Nights Dream the film eg the last scene with Kevin Kline watching Titania as light spirit decorating the night skies
__label__Positive	Everyone Ive ever given an Amazon gift certificate to has loved it No returns no disappointments This is the goto gift when were not sure what to get someone we know they will love
__label__Positive	Gift cards win every time  It was the perfect gift and the perfect packaging

__label__Positive	Thanks
__label__Positive	Easy way to send a gift to anyone Greatly appreciated by the recipient
__label__Positive	I have done this twice very easy and helpful especially if you dont live in the same country as the recipient  Postage overseas is expensive
__label__Positive	This was a gift  Ill assume they liked it since they picked it out
__label__Positive	Replacement cards were delivered sooner than notified THANK YOU
__label__Positive	Very pleased with the Amazon gift card as Im able to send a gift and let the recipient purchase what they want
__label__Negative	Amazon gift cards are not deliverable if you mistype the email address And Amazon does not give you a way to reset the email address and resend Refund takes forever
__label__Positive	I found the process easy to use and if you are a procrastinator like I am is it a quick good way to purchase a gift card  I was able to buy and print right before I planned to give it
__label__Negative	Buyer beware My gift card had a  1500 value
__label__Positive	Was delivered as promised and the recipient was thrilled  Such an easy way to shop and the gift card has already been used on Amazon for something the recipient really wanted  Thanks for offering this wonderful way to shop
__label__Positive	like using amazon gift cards as theyre easy to purchase and instantly sent to family in the US will continue to use them
__label__Positive	What can I say Amazon gift cards work well if youre in a hurry to do something and the recipient is into Amazon I have been asked not to give store cards but never asked not to give Amazon cards
__label__Positive	I received an Amazon gift card from my brother used it transaction went smooth it worked i received my package and that was that what else can I say in 20 words
__label__Positive	Could have been shipped Faster but was well received
__label__Positive	Simply amazing I am able to use these cards to purchase Taco Bell from my local Taco Bell

__label__Positive	Very cute item
__label__Positive	Did what I needed it to do
__label__Positive	Well not sure what else to say about this gift card other than I received it in a promptly manner
__label__Negative	There are numerous  bugs trying to redeem these and airbnb customer service is extremely difficult to reach and unhelpful one member of their support team actually copypasted advice from a customer review here on amazon in his response to me Terribly unprofessional and a huge waste of time and money
__label__Positive	ok

Easy to redeem the certificate using amazon
Will be a great gift for someone
The box is so pretty I have ordered lots of them and used it for decoration during the holidays
Gift card will never expire

CONS
The box is small About 35 inches lengthbreadth And about 5 inches in height
The box is soft and can benddent easily

__label__Positive	Awsome
__label__Positive	my secretary liked it a lot
__label__Negative	Not all tins  some boxes  some tins are product labeled  some tins are dented  no tins arrived that were pictured
__label__Positive	great
__label__Positive	I purchased this as a Christmas gift  It came nicely packaged and undamaged  The card case is a nice touch  Amazon could charge a little something extra for the case if they wanted and it would still be a good deal since the case is certainly nice enough to be reused multiple times

__label__Positive	Cool
__label__Negative	I purchased these gift card for a Christmas gift and was led to believe that the card they came in was to be personalized with a message I chose to have written on it When they came I found the cards to be blank and written on a plain piece of paper was the messages I thought were to be printed on the card that the gift card came with When I called they said they would send out three more When the new cards came they were identical I called back and then was told that the cards dont come with a message  that I was to cut out the message on the plain piece of paper they sent me and then stuck in the card Why would I do that when I could personally right it on the card myself VERY DISAPOINTING
__label__Positive	LOL my husband loved the box as much as the gift card  Hes using it to hold some tiny treasures  He used the gift card right away and purchased himself what he wanted Great gift

__label__Positive	Very nice product
__label__Positive	This is a convenient way to gift friends that are  frequent users of this site  I enjoy getting this gift as well
__label__Positive	Weve used these several times  A few clicks and everyone is happy  They are delivered right on time  It seems as you click from page to page there are repetitions in what is offered
__label__Positive	Amazon has something for everyone  The problem is knowing just what everyone likes  This solves the problem  Also solves the problem of delivering a gift on time when you have procrastinated  Delivers almost instantly
__label__Positive	good
__label__Positive	Fast Efficient Receiver Can Choose What They Want  Everyone Loves Amazon Its as simple as having an email addess Great for Birthday or Anytime
__label__Negative	I ordered a 40 gift card on Dec 12 as a Christmas gift Using tracking it was estimated to arrive on the 18th a further update said it was still shipping on mid afternoon on the 24th and arrived in the afternoon on the 26th That is not my idea of a Christmas gift

I was stunned that it didnt arrive in time of all the items that I ordered this year from Amazon I thought I wouldnt have a problem at all with your gift card It leaves a big question mark in my thinking now Im not sure that one of your gift cards will be a good option in the future

__label__Neutral	Ok this ones partially on me partially on them I was looking for a right now solution to my Starbucks thirst and I thought digital meant well digital No it doesnt it means they send you a paper card in the mail instead of plastic Which is still pretty wasteful by my thinking On the other hand Id have known that if Id read even a single review beforehand but still the title is pretty misleading

But hey 25 in Starbucks bucks no problem there at least
__label__Positive	cuando se podia tener gif que lastima

__label__Positive	I gave these for Christmas gifts Everyone loved them Easy gift to give Love Love Love Amazon
__label__Positive	Simple Fast  fun to the point
__label__Positive	After reading other reviews about delivery delays I set up my order for 3 gift cards as separate orders adding to my eCart and purchasing each as a singlecard order  It only took about 30 seconds for me to receive the confirmation email and the actual gift code email was only about a minute behind each confirmation  I also used the payment method it defaulted to when I went to Checkout  Maybe it was just the right combination to get the job done

As far as redeeming the code I will give a preemptive 5star review now and if any of the 3 recipients report having issues I will revise this review to reflect the details

Another thing I found lots of critiques about Kindle problems You need to go to Amazoncom on your computer not Kindle and click Gift Card Redeem a Gift Card Sign in Then you will enter your redeeming code and click Apply to Your Account Now you will have money shown as balance on top of your Amazon homepage Finally you can then buy a book on Kindle
